</p> <p></p> <p>I love this. One of the things that I love about the ocean is looking at the surf, and once you come to understand the amazing amount of life that lives in our oceans, watching those waves is like watching endless potential crashing in&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s out in the open sea, or at the beach &#8211; looking at that water, and knowing the life that lives beneath those waves, you come to realize that it&#8217;s nothing more than a thin membrane between you and the possibility of thousands, millions, of different stories that are playing out right now, every second. </p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dustin+humphrey&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=imvnso&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dlkOT7DTEeapiAL2q8SzDQ&amp;ved=0CCkQsAQ&amp;biw=1599&amp;bih=859">I look at his work</a></b>, and it reminds me of that feeling of magic. </p>

<p>I am a big believer in teaching people to use better and stronger passwords, and to be more security-aware in a world where everything is potentially up for grabs. It's not a matter of "if", but "when" you're going to get tagged somehow - so the best you can do is to reduce frequency of it by being smart about online security. And one of the best ways to do that is to use a strong password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter <strong><a href="http://www.nakedpassword.com/" target="_blank">Naked Password</a></strong>. The stronger your password is, the more clothing "Sally" will remove:&nbsp;</p>

It's certainly a novel way to approach security, but as <strong><a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/03/01/stripping-girls-dont-guarantee-secure-passwords/" target="_blank">Sophos</a></strong> pointed out, the implementation leaves a lot to be desired: Password123 was enough to get her completely stripped down to the bare 8-bit pixels. Personally, I can see someone creating a far more graphic version that's actually a social-engineering trick into gathering passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some sort of reward-based system for password security is a good idea, even if it's the equivalent of a farmville gift.&nbsp;</p>

<p>        </p><div> <p>As this is a public blog, my private life doesn&#8217;t explicitly enter into what I post here. The details of where I work, who I choose to spend my time with, and what I do with those people is heavily filtered even when it is shared. But there are certain days when the weight of reality makes it so you only have the energy to wear only the face of your heart, and not the one you like to share with the world. </p> <p></p> <p>Today is the one year anniversary of my father passing away. </p> <p></p> <p>Today is also Friday, wherein I usually share a &#8220;slice of cheese&#8221; in the form of techno &#8211; something near and dear to my heart (even the really BAD stuff) because I got to discover it all on my own, in the pre-internet days. But today doesn&#8217;t deserve a slab of pimento-loaf cheddar. Today, it&#8217;s a slice of the truly good stuff. </p> <p></p> <p>This is the first song by a techno artist that literally made me have to pull the car over and cry. At the time, there was no particular association for me &#8211; I didn&#8217;t feel connected to a powerful moment, I just simply <b><i>felt</i></b>. I&#8217;d picked up the CD, and was listening to it in my car for the first time, and was literally just taken somewhere else &#8211; not just taken, but nearly bodily picked up. Even now, 12 years after I first heard it, I&#8217;m listening to it and only now noticing the tears. </p> <p></p> <p>This is the song that, when people get in my face about how music made with electronics has no soul, is my rebuttal. This is the song that makes me thank whatever powers that be out there that I was raised by the people that I was, because out of so many things they taught me, they taught me the love of music (even if we never quite saw eye to eye on what constituted good music).</p> <p></p> <p>I ask that you give it a listen, and be patient with the very long lead in, and listen through to the end. I truly don&#8217;t believe that you will be disappointed. </p> </div>

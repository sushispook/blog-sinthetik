While that may alarm some people, Facebook and Politico say the entire process is automated and no Facebook employees read the posts.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Rather, every post and comment &#8212; both public and private &#8212; by a U.S. user that mentions a presidential candidate&#8217;s name will be fed through a sentiment analysis tool that spits out anonymized measures of the general U.S. Facebook population.</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/01/15/slut_shaming_2_0/singleton/">Salon &#8211; Slut-shaming 2.0</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Most of the women &#8212; and it is mostly women &#8212; who find themselves the subject of posts on TheDirty are less in the public eye than Jones. The content is submitted by scorned exes, former friends and total strangers. A typical post calls out a woman, using her full name and at least one photo, for either having too much sex or for being unattractive. A recent post headlined, &#8220;[Redacted] Should Think About Her Decisions In Life,&#8221; featured a semi-nude photo of the woman in question, along with this user-submitted gem:</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: 1.0in;"><i>This B*tch right here is [redacted], of Reno. She has been with 7 different guys in the past 2 week and I could not tell you what her total number is.

According to The Guardian, these stop-and-search stats represent &quot;the worst international record of discrimination involving stop and search.&quot; The report was compiled by the London School of Economics and the Open Society Justice Initiative.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>The rate of stop-and-search for black people in England and Wales has nearly tripled since 2009, when police and government and everyone else agreed it was a serious problem that should be dealt with.

You'll wake up feeling rested, refreshed, and ready for a smoke.&quot; In addition to the Sinus PM cigarettes, Philip Morris will later this month introduce its new line of Non-Drowsy Daytime Formula 100s and Copenhagen Smokeless Birth Control Dipping Tobacco.</i></p>

<p>Considering I still use livejournal, I&#8217;m not exactly the posterboy for abandoning old or slightly worn technology in favor of the Big New Thing. I&#8217;m utterly flabbergasted that I not only own an iPad, but fucking <b><i>love it</i></b>. I resisted Facebook up until a couple of years ago and then gave in. And if I could go back in time and encase the founders of twitter in lucite, fuck yeah time travel. </p><p></p><p>It takes a lot to pry me off of a given service that I&#8217;ve enjoyed and used in the past. I think I finally stopped using WinAmp about a year ago&#8230; but today? </p><p></p><p>Today was the day I kissed AIM and Yahoo! IM goodbye. Because I realized that only one out of the last 100 interactions was with a person&#8230; and the other 99 were all spambot related. So fuck it, all done, no more. This leaves gchat as the only instant messenger client I use, and really, that&#8217;s just perfectly fine. </p><p></p><p>And one of these days, I&#8217;ll stop chasing the kids off of my lawn and actually use skype for the first time. </p>

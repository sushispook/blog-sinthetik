       <p>All comments are now moderated, and will not appear pending admin approval. And since I'm the only admin, I'll be approving it. Anonymous comments, while still allowed, are far less likely to be approved and posted. As I said elsewhere, have the courage of your convictions to post as yourself, and not as an anonymous sock puppet. </p> <p></p> <p>You do <b>not</b> have to have an account with posterous to log in - you can log in via your facebook or twitter credentials. And while I understand people's trepidation about allowing a site access via an application to Facebook, so far posterous has Done No Evil. </p>

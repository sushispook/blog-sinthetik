       <p>It's pretty dang clear that I love pin-ups here, especially of curvy women (I'm not slamming any healthy body-type, it's just my preference). I subscribe to all sorts of tumblr blogs and other websites that either specialize in that sort of thing, or tend to be more like 4chan (but without the crushingly annoying memes and in-speak), and as I scroll through, I'll randomly download stuff to look at later. And sometimes &quot;later&quot; is weeks later, so I've pretty much spaced on what came from where. </p> <p></p> <p>So scrolling through this catch-all folder during a break today, I do a double-take - because here's a beautiful and amazingly flattering photo of someone who is a doppelganger of someone I know. And I mean dead-ringer - the wife and I agreed that you could be looking at a clone (no, I won't say who and I won't share the photo - don't ask, because I won't tell). I'm 95% sure it's not them, due to a certain identifying characteristic, but it's not a matter of resemblance, it's just eerie how <i>identical</i> the person in this picture looks. </p> <p></p> <p>There's a watermark on the picture, and when I googled it, it took me to the login page of a clearly broken and defunct &quot;premium&quot; (ie, pay to view) website. This is the internet after all, and it would not be the first time an unscrupulous webmaster had taken someone's private photo that had leaked out and put it behind a paywall</p> <p></p> <p>So, the question is this - if <b>you</b> were the person who bore the nearly identical image of this pin-up pic, would you want someone to tell you? If you had pin-up pics taken in the past, and ended up making some spare dough on the side by selling them to a website in the past, would you want someone coming up to you and saying &quot;Is this you topless?&quot;</p> <p></p> <p>I'm pretty sure it goes without saying with this crowd, but anyone who starts a conversation along the line of &quot;But how could anyone pose nude?&quot; or &quot;How could anyone sell naked pictures of themselves?&quot; will not be tolerated. I don't have to explain <i>why</i>, right? Right, good. </p>

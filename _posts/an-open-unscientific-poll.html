Please feel free to respond to this wherever you see this. <p /><div><b>Question:</b> Omitting entirely &quot;because this is where all my friends/family/headcrab candidates are&quot; and &quot;because Myspace is a festering pox-ridden blight oozing puss across the web&quot;, why do you use Facebook as opposed to any other social network? No right or wrong answers - I just want to know. </div>

<p>For the most part, I&rsquo;m pretty much over &ldquo;engrish&rdquo;, especially given the viewpoint that should I ever attempt to try to speak an Asian language, I&rsquo;d likely get it so horrifically wrong that women and children would be spontaneously defecating over the sheer hilarity of it. But the stuff that still gets me, is the complete and total random pastiche of pop culture objects randomly grabbed and hurled into photoshop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which brings me to the greatest backpack ever, anywhere, anywhen:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<img alt="Image001" height="454" src="/media/getfile/files.posterous.com/sushispook/qfSl6X0AVapRuW9su3BHT3UZwpOi0ynn4qz64PN3LEzOdrUHM2sDUGOJuR6X/image001.png" width="350" />
</div>
</p>

<p>Go ahead and try and rationalize a reason why all five of those things are connected and should be presented thusly. You can&rsquo;t, and by the way, you just burst a blood vessel in your brain trying.</p>

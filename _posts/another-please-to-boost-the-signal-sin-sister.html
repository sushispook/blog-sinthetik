<p>I would like you to stop and consider the word "Sin", for a moment. Merriam-Webster's dictionary defines the concept as such:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</div>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>... and the act, thusly:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<img alt="Image002" height="445" src="/media/getfile/files.posterous.com/sushispook/DMyDxVCScr3dGIqpOqjoh9Y9fur0dM7r9zQRjXuthWL2Rv9LcwfVB0Wo1IJJ/image002.png" width="450" />
</div>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your own personal definition may differ to varying degrees... but whether you adhere to the dictionary definition, or your own interpretation, I'd like you to hold it in your mind's eye - contemplate what the concept and act of sin truly means <strong>to you</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have it? Is it there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, good. Now... consider the word "Naughty" - especially in the adult sense. Got that in your mind's eye? Good. Now, I know this sounds like homework, but trust me when I tell you that it most definitely is the kind you will enjoy. Take a moment, and watch the following two videos, and think of "Sin" on one side, and "Naughty" on the other, and think about where they fall in between.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that, given the two choices, "Sin" definitely takes the cake here (and the pie, and the ice cream, and the sprinkles and all the goddamn toppings). And I know I'm not the only one - so Miss Balla Fire and Madamn Chartreuse are very appropriately teamed as <strong>Sin Sisters Burlesque</strong>. And possession being nine-tenths of the law, they're savvy enough to own the trademark as well. And rightly so, because it's not just the name they perform under, it's also the name under which they offer classes and workshops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, you can make the argument that someone else could arrive at that name for their burlesque troupe. And certainly, the path there is quite clear... but we also live in the age of The Google, where you can find out if it's been done before, and more importantly, <strong><em>if someone else is still doing it</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this is important because another burlesque troupe out there has also decided to use the name "Sin Sisters". And it can be safely said that they do <strong><em>not</em></strong> hold the trademark. And while a casual perusal of what they've shared on the web is certainly naughty in the very best tradition of the word, when it comes to "Sin", I know where my vote goes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what can you do? First off, don't consider this a call to arms - pitchforks and torches should be the domain of the trained performers anyways - but rather a call for <strong>results</strong>, a call for <strong>numbers</strong>. So if you're willing to stand up for <strong><em>real</em></strong> sin, take a moment to slide on over to the youtube and spend some quality time watching <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MadamChartreuse">Madamn Charteuse</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=miss+balla+fire&amp;aq=f">Miss Balla Fire</a></strong>, and leave your comments and upvote 'em with likes. Tell your friends. Hell, if you've got that kind of relationship with 'em, tell your neighbors too. Don't go throwing mud, just go and watch the living definition of "Sin Sisters" and spread the Good Word About Sin by sharing the shit out of this URL to get the word out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, it's a <em>bit</em> like homework - but if you're going to get told to make the world better by watching amazing performers not just merely take their clothes off, but bust their asses to entertain and delight... I can assure you, you're not going to get a better offer on that today from anyone, anywhere. And likely not tomorrow, next week, next year, or ever. Thems is good odds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And truly, if for no other reason, because they're good people out there helping to make great <strong><a href="http://www.hubbahubbarevue.com/">live entertainment happen</a></strong>, which is one of the most precious resources available in such a commoditized world. And who knows, you might just find a reason to come on out to see them, make new friends, and uncover another reason why life can be just <strong>so fucking awesome</strong>. The odds are good you'll see me there smiling as I'm reminded of how life is beautiful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">PS: I totally realize that both times now that I've asked people to boost the signal, it's been either wholly, or in part, to aid Amazons. Won't SOMEONE think of the Amazons? Save the American Amazon!</span></p>

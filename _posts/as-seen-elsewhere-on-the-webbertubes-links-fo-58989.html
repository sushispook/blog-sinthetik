      <p><b><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/obiy1/i_laughed_way_too_hard_at_this_when_we_read_it_in/c3g52rb">Reddit &#8211; &#8220;Because China&#8221; is the only way to put it</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>It's not a land in which the foreigner suffers. It is not a hostile land or a wild land. It is, rather, a land of pointless minor absurdities and wholly unnecessary inconveniences, which coalesce to infuriate the ill-tempered and delight the rest. When I first arrived, I was informed by a nice older gentleman, &quot;FIRSTNAME, do not ever ask 'why' here. You can ask yourself any other question, and the answers will enlighten you. But do not ask 'why,' because here, there is no 'why.'&quot; And he was right. The answer--the only answer--to &quot;why&quot; is &quot;because China.&quot;</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://borderhouseblog.com/?p=7552">The Border House &#8211; In games, I&#8217;m always someone I&#8217;m not because I&#8217;m fat</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>I wrote in the past about how a former coworker of mine made a fat avatar in Second Life.&nbsp; He was accused of griefing, was called ugly and grotesque. The other residents in Second Life couldn&#8217;t possibly fathom why, when given the chance, someone would make the conscious decision to make a fat avatar instead of the societal ideal. After all, the vast majority of user-created clothing and accessories in Second Life are built for the thin avatars &#8212; the mesh and textures just don&#8217;t stretch right on a fat avatar. Doesn&#8217;t everyone want to live in a world where everyone is perfectly ideal? My coworker ended up deleting the character and making a new thin one just so he could get the community to interact cordially with him.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.scarysextoyfriday.com/2010/10/scary-sextoy-friday-sweeper.html">Scary Sextoy Friday &#8211; The Sweeper</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>In fact, all I can think of when I look at this is a fetishy version of Benny Hill: the clumsy sub wearing this proceeds to knock over shelves of delicate china and expensive bondage equipment each time he turns his head, while furious dommes chase him around the room as Yakkety Sax plays in the background. Hell, throw a latex gorilla in there and I would TOTALLY watch that movie.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ofac2/why_4_year_olds_arent_allowed_to_make_pizza/">Why 4 year olds aren&#8217;t allowed to make pizza</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

On this day, children may carry a hat or cap in their hand, and anyone may toss a coin into it. Anyone who does is entitled to tell the child about an instance from the past year where the malevolent forces of the world clearly conspired against any sensible probability. The child is expected to listen attentively and reply with the ritual words: &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s just incredibly bad luck, that is!&#8221;</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/warmer-lizard-intelligence/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired%2Findex+%28Wired%3A+Index+3+%28Top+Stories+2%29%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Wired - I, For One, Welcome Our New Lizard Overlords</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>When researchers incubated the eggs of Bassiana duperreyi, a mountain-dwelling Australian skink, at warmer-than-usual temperatures, they grew up to perform especially well on a learning task. &#8220;We have 16 to 17 years of data on the effects of incubation temperature on skinks. We know the hotter guys are bigger, faster, absorb more [egg] yolk,&#8221; said herpetologist Joshua Amiel of the University of Sydney, whose research was published Jan. 11 in Biology Letters. &#8220;But hardly anyone has given a look at the effect on reptile learning.&#8221;</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.jimchines.com/2012/01/striking-a-pose/">Jim Hines &#8211; Striking a Pose (Women and Fantasy Covers)</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>In all seriousness, I spent the rest of last night with pain running through most of my back. Even the pose in The Shape of Desire, which first struck me as rather low-key, is difficult to imitate and feels really forced.

Our porn has become boring and, in my opinion, it might have much to do with this unrealistic and unromanticized version of physical pleasure. Women seem to think that a quick, rough and raunchy screw is the definition of &quot;sexy&quot; for men. Men seem to think that a sweaty, all night, creatively impressive, position-fest is the answer. Although both have their place, that isn't the only way to give your partner the ultimate satisfaction. Taking the time to kiss, caress and hold one another is so important and the ability to really listen to one another is essential.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Found via <b><a href="http://postmodsexgeek.tumblr.com/">PostModSexGeek</a></b></span></p>

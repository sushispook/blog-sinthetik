      <p><b><a href="http://purrversatility.blogspot.com/2012/01/why-working-hard-for-privilege-doesnt.html">Why working hard for privilege doesn&#8217;t negate that privilege</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>What saddens me is that people are so defensive about looking at their privileges, rather than grateful that they are in a place to explore them and use that privilege to help others who don't have that access. I use my white privilege to educate myself on racism, for example, and as a weapon to be a better anti-racist, rather than be butthurt when someone points out my privilege, y'know?</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.thebulletin.org/content/media-center/announcements/2012/01/10/doomsday-clock-moves-1-minute-closer-to-midnight">Doomsday clock moves 1 minute closer to midnight</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>In a formal statement issued at the time of today's announcement, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists noted: &quot;It is five minutes to midnight. Two years ago, it appeared that world leaders might address the truly global threats that we face. In many cases, that trend has not continued or been reversed. <b>For that reason, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is moving the clock hand one minute closer to midnight, back to its time in 2007</b>.&quot;</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-dawn/201201/what-rick-santorum-doesn-t-know-about-sex">What Rick Santorum doesn&#8217;t know about sex</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Santorum has argued that contraception is morally wrong because, &#8220;It&#8217;s a license to do things in a sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be.&#8221; But human beings happily experience, witness, imagine, and lament a cornucopia of erotic encounters that couldn&#8217;t possibly result in conception. Leaving aside the many &#8220;perversions&#8221; happily practiced by humans the world over, the human female is available even for Vatican-approved missionary position intercourse&#8212;at least theoretically&#8212;when she&#8217;s menstruating, already pregnant, post-menopausal, or otherwise precluded from conceiving. Is this, too, an abomination? Even Santorum and his wife, who have had more children than most couples, have certainly had a lot more non-reproductive than reproductive sex over the years.</i></p> <p></p> <p>&#8220;<b><a href="http://terminallysnarky.com/2012/01/10/you-look-like-you-lost-weight/">You look like you lost weight!</a></b>&#8221;:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Now think about this supposed compliment. Why couldn&#8217;t you just say, &#8220;You look amazing/beautiful/gorgeous!&#8221; or, &#8220;How handsome are you, is that a new shirt?&#8221; or, &#8220;Hot damn!&#8221; Why would you mitigate a compliment with the suggestion that an individual looks that way because of his or her weight? Even if it&#8217;s true. Regardless of whether you think that fat is ugly, and regardless of whether you actually think that this person only looks good because he or she has lost weight, why not just compliment him or her? Why not remember that part of what makes this peson attractive is personality, smile, eyes, hair, dimples, and so on, and so forth? Why not forget which size jeans this person wears for the seconds it takes to compliment him or her?</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>You don&#8217;t need to put your assumptions about beauty and health on your friend&#8217;s plate&#8212;believe it or not, we overweight types don&#8217;t want to eat everything that is put in front of us. Reconsider your choice of words. Compliment the person, not the size.</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/5184-Serious-Sam-3-BFE">Zero Punctuation reviews Serious Sam 3</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Well that&#8217;s time travel for you&#8230; doing to simple linear storytelling what energetic sex with a contortionist does to a smoothly laid-out bedsheet. </i></p>

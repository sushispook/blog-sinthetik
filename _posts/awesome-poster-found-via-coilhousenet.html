<p>I <em>adore</em> this &ndash; because I was always that boy. <strong>Always</strong>. Including the E-Z-Bake Oven. I grew up watching musicals (I think you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to have found any other 10 year boy old in the 80&rsquo;s who had seen that many Esther Williams movies), surrounded by my sister and my mother. I always immediately despaired when seeing commercials during cartoon blocks of kids playing sports, because that was just not me &ndash; I never enjoyed it (although I am to understand I was a great fullback in soccer, I really didn&rsquo;t like it). I love this <strong><em>tons</em></strong>.</p>

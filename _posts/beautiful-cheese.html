<p>In fact, it&#39;s not really cheesy at all...</p><p /><div>When I saw Moby in &#39;99, touring in support of the &quot;Play&quot; album, Boom Boom Satellites opened for them. I really enjoyed the stuff they played live, but was deeply annoyed when I heard absolutely none of it on the album I picked up. So I didn&#39;t really give it a chance as I should. A few months later, I really sat down and listened to it, and totally fell in love with it... </div> <p /><div>This is just one of those beautiful songs that you can imagine watching a sunrise, sunset, or the end of the world to. </div>

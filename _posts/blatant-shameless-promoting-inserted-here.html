       <p>Granted the sound is stir-fried buttocks, and you&#8217;re not exactly seeing what&#8217;s going on&#8230;.</p> <p></p> <p><iframe allowfullscreen src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LIg4dT2kZrM?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p> <p></p> <p>&#8230; but for those of you that couldn&#8217;t make the show, here&#8217;s a sound clip. And for those of you new here, this would be The Razor Skyline&#8217;s return gig. Pretty frickin&#8217; awesome, but I&#8217;m a bit biased, being married to the lead singer and all. </p>

Sadly, I am not at all surprised that this was made in the UK, and not in the US. Nintendo knows that the culture in the US is such that having your family product associated with a mother who is a NAUGHTY DANCER would brand the Wii as the console of immoral harlots (which we all know is the xbox 360, of course).&nbsp;</p>

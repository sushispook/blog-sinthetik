You may or may not have noticed when visiting this site, that there's a list of websites under "Other Sites to See" on the right-hand side. While the majority of them are NOT safe for work (and in the case of SpaceGhetto, NOT safe for life and often vomitously horrifying - there's something to that whole desensitization thing for me, but not for everyone), they will take you to places where I find the majority of my content. And one of those is the always fantastic <strong><a href="http://rmjwell.livejournal.com/tag/bpod" target="_blank">Burlesque Picture Of the Day (BPOD)</a></strong>. And if you're wondering if you should make it part of your daily routine, check the above pic again.&nbsp;</p>

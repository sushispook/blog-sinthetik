Often my female characters&#8217; stories are interlaced with another character of mine that may relate more closely to me. But almost never in a romantic capacity, they tend to be sisters or apprentices or mentors of my other characters.&#8221;</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/post-sopa-the-path-forward-for-addressing-piracy.ars">Ars Technica &#8211; Post-SOPA: the path forward for addressing piracy</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>The number of high-quality services that &quot;compete with free&quot; is growing&#8212;and some of the credit is certainly due to the major content conglomerates, which have made it easier to license and use their digital material. As a recent subscriber to Rdio, it's hard for me to imagine anyone who would even want to go to the hassle of pirating music when 13 million tracks are ready to be dialed up in instant, high-quality streams, complete with album art. For $4.99 a month&#8212;the cost of the Web-only unlimited subscription&#8212;you would have be one cheap bastard with way too much time on your hands to scour P2P networks instead. Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Spotify, and iTunes are all terrific services that have been well-used in my household; we've even rented HD movies through the Xbox. All provide a much better experience than the older one of driving to a store and browsing the shelves. When done well, such services are the best way to make piracy irrelevant. We need even more of them.</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/everything-you-know-about-corsets-is-false/">Collectors Weekly &#8211; Everything You Know About Corsets Is False</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Even though so-called &#8220;tight-lacing&#8221; was popular during the late 1800s, women rarely reduced their waists more than 1-2 inches. Generally, a corset with a 20-inch waist would be worn with a gap in the back, so the woman&#8217;s corseted waist measured between 22 and 26 inches. Where did these tales of ladies of the court and their obscenely tiny 13-inch waists come from? Fetish fantasy literature of the era. &#8220;A lot of people believe in the 16-inch waist being typical when, of course, most corsets were no smaller than in the 20s,&#8221; Steele says. &#8220;Most people would reduce to a couple of inches. You can reduce it 4 inches or so, but most women were not going to be doing any more than that</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;">Found via <b><a href="http://fattyfatfashionblog.blogspot.com/">FattyFat Fashion</a></b>&#8217;s <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Fattyfat-Fashion-blog/118105108254241">Facebook Page</a></b></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-5-stupidest-habits-you-develop-growing-up-poor/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CrackedRSS+%28Cracked%3A+All+Posts%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Cracked.com - The 5 Stupidest Habits You Develop Growing Up Poor</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>People who have never been poor love to point out overweight people in the ghetto and sarcastically exclaim, &quot;Yeah, it really looks like she's starving!&quot; And they have no idea that the reason many of them have weight problems is because everything they're putting into their bodies is dirt-cheap, processed bullshit. Grab a TV dinner and look at the nutritional information. Fresh food is expensive and takes forever to prepare. It goes bad quickly, so it requires multiple trips to the grocery store per week, which is something most impoverished people can't do. And since all of those time-saving frozen meals are high in salt and fat, they take up residence in the expanding asses of the people who can't afford anything else. When you finally get to the point where you can afford those grocery trips and fresh ingredients and have the time to prepare them, your taste buds freak the fuck out. They're not used to it. Vegetables are supposed to be squishy, aren't they? Is chicken supposed to have this texture?</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://jezebel.com/5877300/the-purity-bear-will-cockblock-you-until-youre-married">Jezebel &#8211; The Purity Bear Will Cockblock You Until You&#8217;re Married</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>This Purity Bear video also teaches us an important lesson about women, namely that they're usually the ones responsible for tricking men into getting turned on, and they're always demanding sex from poor, defenseless, virtuous, chaste dudes. It happened in Twilight when Bella spent like 3 books humping Edward's leg before he agreed to put out, it happened to Sir Galahad, the Chaste in that castle full of horny virgins, and it's happening here, right on this now besotted doorstep. For shame, woman. For shame, women.</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/dry-humping-an-adequate-sex-alternative-for-teens,27084/">The Onion - Dry Humping An Adequate Sex Alternative For Teens, Says Weird, Unsolicited Report From Department Of Interior</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>&quot;The pantomiming of intercourse prior to the onset of mature sexual relationships is a phenomenon one observes in many cultures,&quot; reads one section of the report. &quot;It's natural for budding, aroused adolescents to explore erogenous-zone stimulation with a partner, and when it comes to achieving physical gratification without disrobing, teens have many options available to them. Young males will even find that ejaculation is not uncommon.&quot; Another section, credited to the department's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, ranks the best places to engage in dry humping using a statistical &quot;dry-pleasure coefficient,&quot; or DPE&#8212;a new metric&nbsp; the Department of the Interior developed solely for the report. The study indicates a soft couch in the finished basement of a mutual friend's house has the highest-known DPE, making it the top location for fully clothed teens to vigorously mount each other.</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://wyden.senate.gov/issues/issue/?id=417403d2-468a-47a6-863f-946b5dbe4a6a">Senator Ron Wyden &#8211; My Letter to the Internet</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>The Senate, however, has scheduled a vote for Tuesday, January 24 at 2:15 PM to override my hold and move the Protect IP Act towards passage.&nbsp; This will be the deciding vote that determines whether PIPA and SOPA move through the Congress or are turned back for more sober discussion. We are up against a group of the biggest, most powerful, well-funded and well-organized interest groups in Washington.&nbsp; No one thought millions of Internet users would speak up or that those voices could overcome the power of these interests.&nbsp; Today you showed that the Internet is not just a platform for ideas, commerce, and expression, but also for political action that will defend those principles.&nbsp; Your voices must continue to be heard.</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/BmC1lZeQad4">Capcom announces Resident Evil 6</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><iframe allowfullscreen src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BmC1lZeQad4?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;">I&#8217;m curious to see how carefully they tread <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_5#Allegations_of_racism">after the last outing</a></b>. </p>

<p>Shoo. Go. Begone. Leg it for a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weather is beautiful. I want to go picnic with folks. Go to the Cal Academy of Sciences. Road trip down to Disneyland. Go jump around in the surf at the beach. Have a bonfire at night. Lie on a roof and stargaze. Watch dachsunds act like dachsunds. Make out with my wife on a ferris wheel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could go on, but you get the idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear User:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that working with your computer is much like dealing with some bargain-basement deity whose unpredictable nature is only overcome by his ability to help you turn your words into paychecks. I&rsquo;m also keenly aware that you&rsquo;ve heard about &ldquo;The Hackers&rdquo;, and how they will use your PC to explode kittens in front of sad orphans all because someone told you that using caps lock too much allows &ldquo;The Hackers&rdquo; to put on 3D goggles and swim through cyberspace to get to your PC. And I <strong>know</strong> you are very wary about viruses, especially after suffering through some real doozies that snuck in and rampaged through our environment like Andy Dick locked in overnight at a pharmacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I get it &ndash; you&rsquo;re flinchy, somewhat terrified, of this terrible and unpredictable box of demonic helper monkeys on your desk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But really, for the love of FUCK &ndash; <strong>STOP FORWARDING ME ATTACHMENTS THAT YOU THINK COULD BE A VIRUS<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">[1]</span></strong></span></span>.</strong> Seriously &ndash; DON&rsquo;T. If you get a cold, you don&rsquo;t jab a hole in your finger, stick in your doctor&rsquo;s mouth, and shout &ldquo;DOES THIS TASTE LIKE HERPES TO YOU?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So stop it. Please. The life you save <strong>will</strong> be your own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

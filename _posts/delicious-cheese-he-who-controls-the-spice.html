<p>This one is fairly self-explanatory...</p><p /><div>One of the things that I&#39;ve always loved about early techno and industrial is the use of audio samples from movies to lend mood and gravitas to a given song. Sometimes it&#39;s done to the point of ridiculous distraction (I&#39;m looking at <i>you</i>, Velvet Acid Christ). Sound effects or bits of dialog, it&#39;s always fun to see something re-framed. This has always been a good example, in my opinion, of that use...</div> <p /><div>There were a lot of one-hit techno wonders in the 90&#39;s who managed to get one moderately fun song out, and cranked out an entire album  full of filler when they suddenly landed themselves a record label contract. Eon&#39;s &quot;Void Dweller&quot; album is a good example of how there were acts out there that didn&#39;t fall to this. Some of it is still dated, but do yourself a favor and look it up - it&#39;s worth at least one listen, especially for the use of samples. </div>

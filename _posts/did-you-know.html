</p> <p></p> <p>&#8230; that you can donate money to Planned Parenthood in someone's name? So, for example, you could give in Susan Komen's name and had the thank you card sent to the Susan G. Komen Foundation at their corporate headquarters:</p> <p></p> <p>5005 LBJ Freeway</p> <p>Dallas TX 75244</p> <p></p> <p>I&#8217;m a white male, so I&#8217;m about as privileged as you can get without having been born into wealth. But almost all of my friends are female, and I&#8217;m married to a woman. Even if it doesn&#8217;t affect you directly, this erosion of reproductive rights through targeted and malicious attachs is horrifying not just for what it represents, but for the collateral damage of actual HEALTH CARE for people who need it. No one&#8217;s body parts should be a pawn in a political game. </p>

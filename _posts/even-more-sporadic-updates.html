      <p>Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t had much time to put together daily links of that which I find informative and amusing, or to write any original content. And I&#8217;m about to embark on even more work-related shenanigans, with increasingly infrequent time to do much of anything. As such, there&#8217;s going to be a certain amount of radio silence here, only occasionally punctuated by the infrequent post. </p> <p></p> <p>If there&#8217;s anything left of me in about a month&#8217;s time, expect some updates then. </p>

      <p>So posterous is being acquired by twitter, and <b><a href="http://posterous.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/56001-acquisition-faq">their FAQ leaves very little doubt that they&#8217;re going to shutter the service</a></b>. So I&#8217;m going to have to figure out how to migrate the whole kit and caboodle elsewhere. So for anyone reading this, I&#8217;m curious what blogging platform you use, and why you like it.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the things I love about posterous is that I don&#8217;t need a specialized client to post &#8211; I can just dump it all into an e-mail and it gets posted. And although they and Livejournal got into a slapfight that kept them from cooperating, posterous does automatically cross-post to everything else out there on the planet &#8211; it&#8217;s kind of nuts. If I had to choose between the two, I&#8217;d pick the latter as being the more important feature to have. </p> <p></p> <p>Rats. I really did get a good ass-groove going here. </p>

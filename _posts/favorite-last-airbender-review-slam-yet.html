<p>Apparently Shyamalan&#8217;s career continues to implode, and has reached the hilariously incandescent wreckage phase &#8211; at least, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m gaging from the gleefully savage reviews. I must admit that when a real stinker comes through, it&#8217;s pure joy to watch movie critics romp around like a puppy with a chew toy, covering it in saliva and bite-marks. <b><a href="http://io9.com/5576076/m-night-shyamalan-finally-made-a-comedy">But this one, courtesy of i09.com</a></b>, has one of my most favorite snarks yet: </p><p></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>This is the part where I would insert a quick plot synopsis of the film, but it's really unnecessary - Shyamalan has boiled every epic heroic story of the past 20 years down to its most basic, primal soup-y essence, so he can spray it all over the audience, in a kind of Hero's-Journey bukkake. You will be finding chunks of Joseph Campbell's calcified spooge behind your ears for three days after watching this film, no matter how many times you bathe.</i></p>

<p>&#8230; <b><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/3526027-417/ketterson-academy-naval-usna-husband.html">I would add another reason for you to understand why separate really isn&#8217;t equal</a>:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i> Hoping to fulfill Fliszar&#8217;s wishes, Ketterson contacted the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis and told them that Fliszar, Class of &#8217;71, had wanted to have his ashes interred at the USNA&#8217;s Columbarium, a serene white marble waterside crypt next to the school&#8217;s cemetery.</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>The memorial coordinator asked about his relationship to the deceased. Ketterson said that John Fliszar was his husband.</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>&#8220;They were always polite, but there was this moment of hesitation,&#8221; Ketterson recalled. &#8220;They said they&#8217;re going to need something in writing from a blood relative. They asked, &#8216;Are you listed on the death certificate?&#8217; &#8216;Do you have a marriage license?&#8217; &#8221;</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>He was and they did, the couple having been married in Des Moines when gay marriage became legal in Iowa two years ago.</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Ketterson sent a copy of the marriage license. That changed everything.</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>&#8220;I was respected,&#8221; he said. &#8220;From that moment on, I was next of kin. They were amazing.&#8221;</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>The USNA alumni association sent Ketterson a letter expressing condolence for the loss of his husband.</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>The USNA says Fliszar&#8217;s interment followed standard operating procedure.</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>&#8220;His next of kin was treated with the same dignity and respect afforded to the next of kin of all USNA grads who desire interment at the Columbarium,&#8221; said Jennifer Erickson, a spokesperson for the academy. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t do anything differently.&#8221;</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Shipmate magazine, the publication of the USNA&#8217;s alumni association, ran Fliszar&#8217;s obituary. It noted his two Purple Hearts for &#8220;having been shot down from the sky twice in military missions.&#8221; It noted &#8220;for the rest of his life he would joke about his &#8216;government issued ankle.&#8217; &#8221; It noted &#8220;his burly but warmly gentle manner.&#8221; It noted he was &#8220;survived by his husband, Mark Thomas Ketterson.&#8221;</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p>(Not to mention Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217; Tell)</p>

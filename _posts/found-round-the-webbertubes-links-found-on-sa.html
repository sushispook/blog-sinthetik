      <p><b><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/violetblue/the-ces-2012-booth-babe-problem/963">Violet Blue &#8211; The CES 2012 booth babe problem</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Present an inappropriate female stereotype and - no surprise - you&#8217;ll create an environment of inappropriate and stereotypical behavior. It&#8217;s not the booth babes, it&#8217;s the reductive booth babe mentality that&#8217;s the real problem here. And the hypocrisy. The irony is that at the same time all that went on for BBC&#8217;s cameras, women who are actually in the business of pornography - having been disallowed to exhibit at CES 2012 - were right next door. They were having conversations about de-stigmatizing sex, new technologies, and creating respectful and appropriate discussions about sex and technology.</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://purrversatility.blogspot.com/2012/01/candid-pornography.html">Kitty Stryker &#8211; Candid Pornography</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Still, regardless of the genders involved, there's a social contract in place that says you should probably ask for permission and typically it's best to get a model release while you're at it, right? If you want to take a photo of someone looking sexy you probably want to make sure they're over the age of consent, at least. Taking photos of people without asking as wank fodder, particularly wank fodder other people pay for, is kind of... sinister. That's exactly what Desi's Candid Big Butts is doing. They have a tumblr and a blogspot where they take photos of women with large derrieres and then post them, with video costing money. Oh, and despite the fact this person does this without asking the women, they watermark all their material... so you don't steal it. IRONY!</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://thedailywh.at/2012/01/14/unemploy-it-of-the-day/">The Daily What &#8211; Unemploy it of the Day</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Work It revolved around the misadventures of two unemployed men who dress up as women to look for work. Hilarity did not ensue. Word of the cancellation comes less than a week after ABC Entertainment President Paul Lee defended the show&#8217;s treatment of transgender women. &#8220;We thought there was room for a very, very, very, very silly show,&#8221; he told reporters.</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-aiba-play-fair-dont-ask-female-boxers-to-wear-skirts">Tell AIBA: Play Fair, Don't Ask Female Boxers to Wear Skirts</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Female boxing will make its Olympic debut in the upcoming London games, but the Amateur International Boxing Association (AIBA) seems intent on keeping the sport in the Victorian era. The organization recently suggested that female boxers wear short skirts in the ring because&nbsp; -get this- it looks more elegant and helps distinguish female boxers from their male counterparts.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;">Thanks to <b><a href="http://www.nowthissound.com/ntsib/">April</a></b> for the link!</p>

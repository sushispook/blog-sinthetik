      <p><b><a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/01/starship-troopers-the-movie">John Scalzi via Tor.com &#8211; There Are So Many Reasons Why You Should Watch Starship Troopers Right Now</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Paul Verhoeven is a director who can give you everything you want in a movie, as long as you want too much of it. This isn&#8217;t a criticism of Verhoeven. It&#8217;s just a fact. Paul Verhoeven makes movies like tuberculosis patients make fever dreams: vivid, disjointed, with all the human emotions pumped up so far that they bleed into each other like a swirl. A lot of people confuse it for camp, but Verhoeven isn&#8217;t out there, winking to the audience. He&#8217;s as serious as a heart attack.</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/news/why-guru3d-probably-never-will-review-ubisoft-titles-anymore/">Why Guru3D probably never will review Ubisoft titles anymore</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>For the NVIDIA setup I take out the GTX 580, and insert a GTX 590. When I now startup the game 'BAM', again an activation is required. Once again I fill out the key and now Ubisoft is thanking me with the message that I ran out of activations. Here's what Ubisofts DRM is doing these days, they don't just verify the number of PCs you work on, nope .. they monitor hardware changes. So once we inserted that GeForce GTX 590 the hardware id # hash changed rendering our activation invalid. This means that if we'd like to make a VGA performance review on Anno 2070 we'd need to purchase the game seven times. Ubisoft claims that you can send an email towards their support so that the activations are reset, we did so .. yet are still awaiting reaction. When contacting Ubisoft marketing here in the Netherlands, their reply goes like this: 'Sorry to disappoint you - the game is indeed restricted to 3 hardware changes and there simply is no way to bypass that. We also do not have 7 copies of the game for you'.</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/12/red-wine-researcher-said-to-falsify-data/">CNN Health &#8211; Red wine researcher said to falsify data</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Following a three-year investigation, a university review board has concluded that Dipak K. Das, Ph.D., the director of the Cardiovascular Research Center at the university's school of medicine, in Farmington, manipulated research data in at least 145 instances. Das is well-known for his research into the heart-healthy properties of resveratrol, a compound found in red wine and certain plants that is now sold widely as a nutritional supplement.</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2012/01/17/if-the-clothes-fit-a-feminist-takes-on-fashion/">Ms. Blog - If the Clothes Fit: A Feminist Takes on Fashion</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>The fact that even the most politically and culturally commanding women must walk a razor&#8217;s edge between looking powerful and still appearing &#8220;appropriately feminine&#8221; underscores visual theorist John Berger&#8217;s concise description of mainstream society: &#8220;Men act and women appear.&#8221; In other words, men are judged by their deeds; women, by their looks. In U.S. politics, Hillary Clinton has experienced the damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don&#8217;t double bind for strong women. If she wears a power pantsuit, it&#8217;s a &#8220;desexualized uniform,&#8221; but if she shows a hint of cleavage&#8212;as she famously did in 2007&#8212;it can ignite a media firestorm that eclipses her political platform.</i></p>

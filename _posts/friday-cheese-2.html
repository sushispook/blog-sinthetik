<p></p><div class="WordSection1"><p>I think I was driving back from Santa Rosa, late on a Saturday night, and the tape deck was non-functional due to a cassette refusing to eject, so it had to be the radio. I twiddled the knobs until I reached Live 105, and heard <b><a href="http://www.stevemasters.com/">Steve Master&#8217;s Modern Mix</a></b>. It wasn&#8217;t until a few years later I started actually digging around and finding techno artists, but one of the songs he played often was this very one. </p></div>

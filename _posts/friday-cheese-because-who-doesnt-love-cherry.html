<p></p><div class="WordSection1"><p>No, this isn&#8217;t a techno cover of that Warrant song. We&#8217;re just getting that right the fuck out of the way immediately, thank you very much. No, this is a B-side to Underworld&#8217;s &#8220;<b><a href="http://youtu.be/BSbn-0c--lI">Pearls Girl</a></b>&#8221; single. And while I&#8217;ve always dug Underworld, I&#8217;ve personally always felt their best when they&#8217;re just going all out no-vocals. Because they&#8217;re one of the few musical acts out there that can replicate the feeling of a beautiful day with friends or your loved ones with the sun on your face or the moon in the sky, without even uttering a single goddamn word. </p></div>

<p>I don't have a huge amount to say about this, other than that I hope someone out there is occasionally listening to these and getting a kick out of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spahn Ranch made a couple of albums in the mid to late 90's that were really great, quite accessible dance. This came as a shock and surprise to many people I knew who seemed to have mentally pigeonholed them away into the same dustbin of industrial genre that sounds like calcified ape-shit shot at lethal velocity into an active woodchipper strapped with dynamite. For those of you who weren't listening to electronic music in the 90's, there really was an epidemic of that sort of thing for a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This track isn't exactly representative of the album... it's more along the lines of the "obligatory instrumental" piece that seemed to happen a lot in this era. You know the one - where the engineer/keyboardist is looking for filler, and tosses a pet musical doodle into the pile to round the album up to 60 minutes or so. I also immediately glommed onto the track, and at the time, thought it was a great musical metaphor for the "busy darkness behind your eyelids" (proving that everyone, at some time in their life, is horridly pretentious sounding - you can't escape it, so just embrace it and enjoy the comedy in retrospect). As such, I was actually scandalized when someone pointed out to me that they'd lifted a riff from Falco's "Der Kommissar".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wankery on my part aside, it is, like many of the others I've shared for Friday Cheese, still a decent song.&nbsp;</p>

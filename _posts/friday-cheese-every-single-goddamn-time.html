<p>When Moby's "I Like To Score" came out, it was The Album for an entire summer. Driving to work from SF to Novato (ugh), grabbing lunch, or stuck in traffic, I listened to that CD obsessively... and holding it in my hands right now, I can see the scratches on the underside. Not enough to prevent it from playing, but definitely enough to show that this disc was well-loved, if not treated gently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The album was a compendium of Moby's pieces that had either been inspired by, or used in Movies &amp; Television, often with some slight re-working to tighten things up, or even a complete re-recording with a new arrangement. "Oil 1", from The Saint soundtrack (yeah, remember that one?) was one of those songs. Great beat, fast but not too fast (great driving music), and upbeat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also has "vocals". Well... moaning. And without fail - EVERY SINGLE TIME - I'd come to a stop sign or light, playing this song with the windows down, and the moaning... and I'd be pulling up to what looked for all the world like a group of church ladies in their car, all glaring at me.</p>

<p>        </p><div class="WordSection1"> <p>I remember 1999. If we survived our electronic toasters going on a berserk murdering rampage due to the date glitch, it would be the beginning of a decade where cyberspace and global villages would solve all of the world&#8217;s problems by allowing us to instantly communicate ideas with each other. Instead, a mentally-deficient goblin and his troll puppet master stole the Whitehouse and drove the country into a ditch, and having everyone communicate online instantly with each other just showed how quickly we could piss each other off. </p> <p></p> <p>So really, KLF got it right when they said &#8220;Fuck the Millennium&#8221;. </p> </div>

<p></p><div class="WordSection1"><p>I don&#8217;t have it in me to re-hash this anniversary in words, <b><a href="http://blog.sinthetik.com/a-slice-of-something-different-for-this-parti-0#comments">when I&#8217;ve done so already</a></b>. Suffice to say that I am in much the same place as I was this time last year, thinking about my Father and how much I truly miss his laughter, kindness, joy, and amazing optimism in spite of what the world so often had served up&#8230; showing us so often the worst that was out there. Dad&#8217;s seemingly unending passion about things has always been a hallmark of how I carried him in my heart, and tomorrow, I&#8217;ll mark the day of his passing and remember the joy he brought. </p><p></p><p>And today, I&#8217;ll share another song that often has wrapped me up in unnamed passion, making me just want to live life. This is a song off that same EP from this time last year. If you have the opportunity to own it, I can&#8217;t recommend it enough. </p><p></p><p>Cheers pop, wherever you might be. &nbsp;</p></div>

In any event, when you walk into the club, you start hearing music that, to me, sounds like it was written as a love note to the Hackers soundtrack. </p> <p></p> <p><iframe allowfullscreen src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NSnZs_9lTcQ?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p>

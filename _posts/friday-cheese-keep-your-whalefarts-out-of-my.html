<p></p><div class="WordSection1"><p>One of the things that makes me facepalm and/or grind my teeth when re-visiting my old collection is how a song with a great structure (excellent beat, great hook and melody) will get utterly trashed by audio samples. In the case of &#8220;Trance&#8221; music, anything that sounded vaguely new-agey would get carelessly thrown in like pepperoni on a little caesar&#8217;s pizza &#8211; and more often than not, it was some blue-whale-with-horrible-gas-underwater thing that was, you know, <b><i>so Gaia</i></b>. </p><p></p><p>This could still be a listenable, if not very good song. Except for the goddamn fucking whalefarts. </p><p></p><p>You assholes. </p></div>

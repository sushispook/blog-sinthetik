<p></p><div class="WordSection1"><p>I remember when I first heard The Orb&#8217;s &#8220;Little Fluffy Clouds&#8221;. It sounded&#8230; familiar, although I wasn&#8217;t really surprised &#8211; Techno is and was never a bastion of individual creativity. A particular breakbeat sample or musical hook would be introduced by one artist, and it would suddenly sweep through several others like the spread of rage-infected monkeys. </p><p></p><p>It&#8217;s not the same song &#8211; it&#8217;s got a less upbeat vibe, and a healthy dose of sci-fi movie/TV samples. It&#8217;s definitely got a strong whiff of cheese coming off of it, but back in the day when it first came out, it was the sort of song where you could sit on the hillside, looking at the city, and just be absolute <b>sure</b> that there was another world right beneath the world full of pure, fun stuff. Especially if you lived in the suburbs. </p></div>

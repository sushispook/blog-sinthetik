<p>EBN is one of those acts that, in my mind, were perfect for the 90's - it's an absolute staggering mystery to me that they didn't get wider recognition and become the sort of act that's somewhere between making excellent music through a hybridization of techno, industrial, dialogue samples, and straight up funk samples, and an absolute event to see live. It's one thing to be entertaining, and it's another think to be wickedly clever. But to be both and stand out and above of much of music of the 90's, and not get the recognition they deserved?

<p>I remember my first summer in my first apartment away from home. It was in downtown San Rafael, where there was almost exactly zero foliage to provide any cooling effect, and there were cement buildings radiating out waves of heat while we all sizzled in our meatsuits. I remember walking into Maximum Music and grabbing a few interesting compilation CD's, and tossing them into the stereo in my room.&nbsp;</p>

<p>... and not long after that, like a long lost friend, the fog rolled in, bathing us all in rapturous ocean moisture. And I will always and forever remember this song as the soundtrack to a fever breaking.&nbsp;</p>

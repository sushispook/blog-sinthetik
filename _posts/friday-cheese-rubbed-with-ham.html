<p>One of my favorite comedians, Patton Oswalt, has a great descriptive phrase that I often use for when I&#39;m exhausted and everything is shiny... shiny to the point where everything looked like it&#39;s been rubbed with ham. </p><p /><div>As I am running a staggering sleep deficit at the moment, this song is absolutely spot-on. My effectiveness at work is on par with the skill of the rapper in this song. Which is to say, rubbed with ham. </div> <p /><div>So. Much. Ham. </div>

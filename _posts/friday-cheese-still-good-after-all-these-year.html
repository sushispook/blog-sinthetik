<p>       </p><div class="WordSection1"> <p>I can recall when I first heard this song &#8211; watching <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainspotting_(novel)#Characters">Marc Renton</a> </b>up on the screen, sweating poison out of every pore in his body as he detoxed from heroin, hallucinating madly all the while. While I&#8217;d previously seen Shallow Grave, and experienced Leftfield&#8217;s musical intro, this was the first time that I truly felt electronic dance music used to fit a scene like a glove, making it tighter and more claustrophobic as you&#8217;re smothered by Marc&#8217;s increasing desperation. And it&#8217;s really no surprise at all that it would be Underworld, after all &#8211; much of their musical catalogue is so deceptively simple, yet so expansively huge in the atmosphere department. </p> <p></p> <p>And it&#8217;s still a <b>damn</b> good song after all these years. </p> </div>

<p>Utah Saints were all over the fuck-place back in 1991 with "Something Good"*, which sampled the shit out of Kate Bush's Cloudbursting, and the Annie Lennox-heavy "What Can You Do For Me". Like many techno acts in the day, they got an album deal based upon the strength of a couple of songs, and put out a full length album that was more filler than meat - in fact, save for today's song, the rest was definitely the audio equivalent of lips, hooves, and got knows what else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having gone straight from heavy metal and directly into techno fandom at the time, I think I was one of the few people who heard "I Want You" and immediately said "FUCK! That's Slayer's 'War Ensemble' they're sampling!"</p>

</p><p></p><p>Just&#8230; you know, keep in mind that the time was 1991, and the place was my late-teens/early 20&#8217;s in suburbia. Today, it&#8217;s one of those time-capsule songs from 20 years ago that not only captures the style of dance music at that time, but also makes you ponder what the hell was wrong with you. Because you guys&#8230; seriously, I listened to this song so much I might as well have worn grooves in the goddamn CD. </p><p></p><p>The thing is, this song screams &#8220;one trick pony&#8221;.

So that&#8217;s just what they did.</p><p></p><p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

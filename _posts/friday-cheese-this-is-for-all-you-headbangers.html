<div class="WordSection1"><p>One of the things about rave compilations is that I never knew what I was going to get. In the pre-internet &amp; CD burning days, everything was a gamble. Often you&#8217;d see a compilation with one song you wanted or had heard and liked, and found out that it was the hook to get you to purchase 11 other absolutely boring and crap tracks. Those were always the dilemma &#8211; how good is that ONE song? Is it good enough to pay $12 for, and take up space on your shelf? </p><p></p><p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</p><p></p><p>There are 14 tracks of crap on this CD &#8211; and I&#8217;m not talking in retrospect, no&#8230; it was just absolute shit right out of the gate on the first listen, explaining exactly why Tower records seemed to have 5-6 copies of this CD that just never ever moved. But track 4? Absolutely hilarious - It cracked me up every god damn time I listened to it, and I simply couldn&#8217;t part with this disc. Listen, and you&#8217;ll see why. </p></div> <p></p><p><div class='p_embed p_audio_embed'>

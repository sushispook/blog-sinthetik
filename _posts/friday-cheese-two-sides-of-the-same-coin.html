      <div> <p>One of the really fun things about remixes, especially with electronic/dance music, is hearing a different take on a song. It's like a cover, and yet &lt;i&gt;not quite&lt;/i&gt;... More like meeting an old friend or lover you haven't seen in ages, and they're not exactly the same person. </p> <p></p> <p>And then sometimes you can't even follow the cord between the two - there's absolutely no conceivable chain of events that could have led from one evolving to the other, and yet there it is on the label - two sides of the same coin. And although these are both remixes of the same song, I can't help but think of them as two different pieces entirely, each with their own mood and color. I include them both, as you are welcome to draw connections between the two and ask yourself just how tenuous they might be. </p> </div>   <p><div class='p_embed p_audio_embed'>

<p>I can't exactly call this <strong>good</strong>&nbsp;cheese. It's... strange cheese... like biting into string cheese and getting the brisk taste of wintergreen-flavored oats. You're not quite sure what just happened, and it's not that it's exactly <em>unpleasant</em>... Just... not quite right.&nbsp;</p>

<em>It's amazing how avante-garde and cutting edge their graphics used to appear</em></p>
<p>Future Sound of London either started ingesting a large amount of chemicals and then made music, or decided to write music that sounded just like they had started ingesting a large amount of chemicals. The album this comes from, ISDN, was meant to be a rare experimental EP, but it was popular enough that it got a few re-pressings. For the most part, I didn't really dig the album, but it was a limited edition thingamabob (or at least it was when I bought it), and at the time I really wanted to believe that there was such a thing as consciousness-expanding music. So I tried. I really did. And for the most part, it continued to inspire me musically the same way a dead haddock does. Which is to say, not really much at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, I'm a sucker for anything that evokes great mental imagery, and this song really made me see giant smoke-belching machinery stretching up into the night sky, attended to by the disembodied sampled voice of Lance Henriksen, with the entire apparatus apparently designed to service or provide amusement to some strange singing female robot in the final stages of disrepair. And so, here you go. It's cheese, although it may taste like a peanut-sauce icee.&nbsp;<div class='p_embed p_audio_embed'>

<p>        </p><div> <p>This is it &#8211; this is <b>the</b> song that totally changed the course of my musical interests. </p> <p></p> <p>In 1992, I was 19, and I&#8217;d been into Heavy Metal pretty much exclusively for the past 3 years. It was the soundtrack to being pissed off about the <b>everything</b>, so it never seemed discordant or wrong. And then one day&#8230;</p> <p></p> <p>&#8230; I literally just wasn&#8217;t pissed off about everything anymore. Like a light switch, I got up, dropped an Exodus CD into the stereo&#8230; and was totally bored. I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to listen to, but Heavy Metal just wasn&#8217;t it &#8211; and I could not figure out, for the life of me, what I was into. And in the pre-internet days, you couldn&#8217;t just scamper through the poppy-fields of bittorrent until you found something pleasing, you were kind of stuck with whatever was on the radio, TV, or what your friends told you about. </p> <p></p> <p>I spent my time at my job, cashier at a movie theater, wondering what the hell I was into now &#8211; I have quite honestly in my life never felt that moment of sudden and total disconnect from what had been a popular past-time. And as I flipped through the paper, seeing what movies were opening (movie cashier = free movies at most of the theaters in the area), I saw the advertisement for &#8220;Cool World&#8221;, and remembered that it looked interesting. So I &amp; and a friend saw it the next day during a matinee showing, and while we were amused by how <i>terrible</i> it was, oh holy crap <b>the music</b>, what WAS that? I had to know more. </p> <p></p> <p>I&#8217;m not sure if this is exactly how it happened, but my recollection is that on the way back from the theater, I stopped into Tower Records and bought the soundtrack CD, and dropped it in when I got home&#8230; and holy fuck <b>yes</b>, there was that sound that I had totally been looking for &#8211; and that was Moby&#8217;s &#8220;Ah-Ah&#8221;. </p> <p></p> <p>Again &#8211; no smartywebs in those days, so I picked up the name &#8220;Moby&#8221;, and looked for his name on other CD&#8217;s. That led me to compilation CD&#8217;s he was on, and I picked up the artists I liked from <b>those</b> compilation CD&#8217;s&#8230; and on it went from there, with pokemon-levels of mania about collecting this really wonderful alien sound that reminded me there was more to life than the suburbs, watching television, or ending up at mother-fucking Dennys <b>AGAIN</b>, because there was nowhere else to go. </p> <p></p> <p>Someone at Tower Records put a few issues of Mondo 2000 next to the techno compilations, and on a whim, I grabbed those, and as over-the-top pretentious as they were, that was my next introduction to something else out there. </p> <p></p> <p>So today&#8217;s chunk &#8216;o techno cheese is that first song that sucked me in. </p> <p></p> <p>(Side note: If for some reason you just HAVE to listen to these songs I&#8217;m posting more often, add the RSS feed URL as a podcast to iTunes, and you&#8217;ll download each song as I post them)</p> </div>

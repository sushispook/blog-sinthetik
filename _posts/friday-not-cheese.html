<p>I think for the month of September, it&#39;s going to be way less cheese-whiz, and more artisan...</p><p /><div>Juno Reactor is one of those bands that kind of sort of rode the &quot;Intelligent Techno&quot; train, but never really had the full member pass. He&#39;s also one of the few electronic acts that have managed to keep producing good electronic music that has a clear line of sight back to the original material, while still being relevant, fun, and inventive. There&#39;s always an extra dimension of gravitas in there, making things seem huge and symphonic without actually resorting to layering sounds on to the point of mush (which is why so much of his work has ended up in soundtracks). </div> <p /><div>I love this one a lot. I hope you do too. <br /><p /><p /></div>

       <p><b><a href="http://www.hotbutteredgun.com/">Hot Buttered Gun</a></b> (link is NSFW) is a site where one pro-domina blogs about her various experiences plying her trade. Right now she&#8217;s wending her way through a list of the various textbook kink definitions, and relating her experiences with said kinks. It&#8217;s written in a way that shows the humor inherent in sex &#8211; a reminder that we should all take a good <b>healthy</b> laugh at what turns us on as a way to understand ourselves better, and have more fun with one of the most fun things in the whole goddamn world: Sex. And we should find the laughter in it, because once you disassociate all humor from something, you start sucking the oxygen out of it, and I&#8217;ll be damned if I&#8217;m going to see that happen to sex.</p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.hotbutteredgun.com/2010/11/s-is-for.html">This entry in particular</a></b> (link is NSFW) gave me the giggles, because I had one of those moments where I imagined something that I would never have conceived of otherwise: Helen Mirren on a steroid rampage. It may take you elsewhere, but I&#8217;m going to cherish the thought of her politely suplexing someone through a table for being unforgivably rude. </p>

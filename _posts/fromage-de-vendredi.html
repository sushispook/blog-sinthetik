<p>        </p><div> <p>This week&#8217;s slice of cheese comes from Orbital (in honor of the fact that they&#8217;re playing tonight). They were the first techno act that I got into that wasn&#8217;t straight up candy-rave, but wasn&#8217;t as mind-numbingly dull as most ambient wank-fests were. This particular song is one that holds up fairly well, considering that its 16 years old. </p> <p></p> <p>Have a listen &#8211; and enjoy. </p> </div>

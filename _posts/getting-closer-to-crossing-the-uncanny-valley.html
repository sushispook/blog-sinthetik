        <p>One of my issues with CGI-generated effects is that it lacks the depth of traditional models. A wonderful example is when Star Trek went all-CGI for the first time, looking at Voyager, versus the models used in the movies thus far:</p> <p></p> <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</p> <p></p> <p>CGI is usually used in two ways: to touch up or remove certain assets in a film, or to almost hyper-kinetically overload the viewer in an attempt to deflect observation of how <b><i>off</i></b> it is - and this only really works for 1 or 2 viewings of the material. Beyond that, the limited magic just... dissipates away. For me, it's become the status-quo that effects will be shiny, loud, and will only incrementally move forward in terms of believability. </p> <p></p> <p>And then I watched this: </p> <p></p> <p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/15630517?portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="283" width="500"></iframe></p> <p></p> <p>The lighting and depth are perfect. Shadowing is absolutely believeable and casts itself naturally. If filmmakers can discipline themselves a bit better on how <b>much</b> they use CGI and <b>how</b> they use it, we might actually regain the ground lost when it comes to CGI replacing so much. </p>

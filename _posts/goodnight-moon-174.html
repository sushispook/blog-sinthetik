</p><p></p><p>You may have noticed that things are really all about vintage-style pinups as part of the whole Goodnight Moon thing. Right now, I&#8217;m loving these &#8211; because apart from the whole sex appeal I find in them, I love the moments they capture. Sure, some of them are staged, but they&#8217;ve got that wonderful haphazard somewhat impromptu feel around them. It&#8217;s so far away from the photoshopped and heavily produced glamor photos of today, and you can feel much of the whimsy coming through. </p><p></p><p>And this one? Is it staged? Or was this a random photo at just the right moment? The fact that I can ponder that makes it so much more human, and so much more relatable. And really, just that much more awesome. </p>

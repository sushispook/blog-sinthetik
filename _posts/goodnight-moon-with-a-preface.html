<p>Let&rsquo;s just get this out there: It <strong>is</strong> about the sex &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not <strong>just </strong>about the sex. It&rsquo;s about fun, it&rsquo;s about beauty, and it&rsquo;s about celebrating what I personally find attractive. When it comes to pin-up/nudity, I know that people don&rsquo;t always want to comment, often because no one wants to appear creepy or slimily objectifying. So, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to gage what people think of it (y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t have to comment, but feel free to use the facebook like button), and I kind of often wonder if people are cringing, enjoying, or rolling their eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then I get this note:</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>Your taste in women - let me tell you, this may seem silly, but from the day you posted <strong><a href="http://www.girlswithslingshots.com/comic/gws557/">a webcomic that had a bartender with a belly pooch</a></strong>, and you talked about how much you *liked* and appreciated that in women? That was the day I started learning how to boost my self esteem. To know that there were people out there that didn't just idolize the thin ideal made me feel about a billion times better about myself, and, hell, about humanity in general.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>And please, oh please, don't ever stop posting those Goodnight Moon posts, because - DANG. :)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Everyone</em></strong> should get a chance to feel good about themselves, in their own body, and feel sexy. I celebrate what I know I love &ndash; and I hope you do too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, back to your regularly-scheduled moon&hellip;</p>

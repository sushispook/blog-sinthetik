Amongst all the other epithets that did get appended to me, high school was an absolute crucible of misery, self-loathing, and burning shame. It didn&#8217;t matter that my sexual orientation was straight, that I had had a girlfriend &#8211; being gay was the biggest insult they could hurl at me. And most of the teachers did not give a shit. And this was the early 90&#8217;s, in Mill Valley, CA, for fuck&#8217;s sake. </p> <p></p> <p>It was used as such an effect verbal cudgel against me, that even though my sister had come out a few years earlier, that I had been introduced to and spent time with some truly amazing people whose sexuality, amazingly enough, didn&#8217;t dictate that they had a repulsive or stereotypical personality, that the very mention of it had to be met with an equally vehement &#8220;I&#8217;m not a fucking queer &#8211; that&#8217;s sick, fuck you&#8221;. And knowing full well that the only way I had to blunt that sort of bullying (even though it was only the slightest deflection) was to buy into that crap, was a truly terrible thing. It also left me feeling supremely panicky about my own sexuality for a few years, because even though being gay wasn&#8217;t bad, it sure was difficult and stigmatized and oh god <i>I looked at that Red Hot Chili Peppers sock poster too long oh god WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?</i></p> <p></p> <p>It was years before I was finally able to walk the walk of real equality in my head, even though I talked the talk. If my sister was a reasonably normal person (for a given value of normal), then why, this could apply to other people too! And all of that, in my head, is just from being mis-labeled as a means of bullying, even when I clearly was hetero. </p> <p></p> <p>The fact that she&#8217;s able to stand up for this should be celebrated. At that age, in our culture, this is a rare and wonderful thing, and it puts a community at a crossroads where they can understand the essential humanity of everyone, regardless of what sex they&#8217;re wired to be attracted to. Here is a golden opportunity, and they are so intent on squandering it that they would rather prove their point by petulantly denying everyone the opportunity to attend prom. </p> <p></p> <p>But what&#8217;s worse is how this codifies hate for an entire generation in that community. While sexual tolerance was mostly given lip service when I went to high school, disparaging remarks were frowned upon, and on occasion, punished. To have to attend a school where they&#8217;ve taught the students that this is such a horrible thing, that it must be hidden from sight at all costs? What will the price be paid down the line? Bullying? Beatings? </p> <p></p> <p>Suicide?</p> <p></p> <p>The continued cherry-picking of biblical verses to support bigotry, while willfully ignoring the inconvenient ones, is one that baffles me. To see a reminder that we still haven&#8217;t learned, collectively, saddens me. For every Constance, who can stand up and be able to say no, I won&#8217;t own your bigotry and I won&#8217;t own any shame for being me, there are so many that are unable to. They&#8217;re the ones who pay the price for this. And everyone in that story is being taught the lesson that someone is worth less than others, because of who they love. </p> <p></p> <p>Holy fucking shit. I still can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re here, and that we still have to have this discussion.</p>

        <p>Okay, so we all know about Christmas miracles, right? Maybe it's money, maybe it's food, and maybe it's just even a roof overhead... and it's always darkest before the miracle comes. </p> <p></p> <p>Well, in terms of Hubba Hubba Revue, it's pretty damn dark right now. And without the miracle of people stepping up and making it to the show tomorrow night, then there isn't going to be any last minute save. That'll be it, finis, done, no more big Hubba at the DNA. </p> <p></p> <p>I spend a lot of time enthusing about Burlesque in general, and Hubba Hubba in particular for a really good reason: it is one of the best, brightest, and most amazing celebrations of everything that is fun and wonderful in the world. And above all, it's <b>unique.</b></p> <p></p> <p>Here's a little story... the wife and I got hooked on burlesque when we first saw a show in Chicago, and a friend dragged us to Hubba Hubba when we moved to the bay area. We figured that's what burlesque was - performers putting in not just sweat and hard work, but their own personality and heart into creating unique performances that reflected their own joy - and we were privileged enough to share in it. God, it was the biggest endorphin rush, and I thought that what a wonderful world it was that there was a big burlesque revival. </p> <p></p> <p>And then we went to Las Vegas. We figured, holy shit, it's the big LV - this is the nexus of opulence and glamor and glitz and over-the-top showmanship. We would get to see some kick ass burlesque - granted, with better production values, because Everything Has To Be Big Out There. So we went and <b><a href="http://www.mgmgrand.com/entertainment/crazy-horse-show.aspx">saw a show</a></b>. After an amazing meal and a wonderful night, we figured it would be the perfect night cap. </p> <p></p> <p>How fucking <b>wrong</b> we were. </p> <p></p> <p>It was bright. It was shiny. It was <b>loud. </b>And oh, it was glossy. And above all, it was so tightly choreographed as to have all the joy and individuality sucked out of it completely. These were performers who, credit where credit is due, were amazingly talented who executed their routines perfectly. But that's what it was... a <i>routine</i>. This is the same performance they hammered out night after night after night, over and over again. There was no whimsy. We felt that we were being performed <b><i>at</i></b>, not for. It would have been the same performance had the room been empty - they drew no energy from the audience, and gave nothing to us to reflect back. </p> <p></p> <p>Coming back to the bay area, going to see Hubba Hubba Revue again and comparing it against the show we saw... it was like comparing a lavish and loving home-made meal versus take-out at Boston Market. We screamed our appreciation at the performers, debuting a new piece for us, and you could see them feed off of that and give it back to us. We were wrapped in camaraderie, joy, so much laughter, sexiness, and oh my god SO MUCH FUN. It was the difference between hearing a live recording, and being there live in the moment and soaking up <b>life</b>. </p> <p></p> <p>Last month, it rained, and the attendance was... pretty awful, actually. And tomorrow, it's supposed to rain. Again. If it's a repeat of last month, then this likely is going to be Hubba Hubba's swan swong - and the thought of a Christmas Show, where every narrative I have ever been taught as a child tells me is when it all turns around because The Good In People Comes Out, becomes the death knell? That won't just be sad, it would be cruel beyond description. </p> <p></p> <p>So come out. Have a drink. Sure, it's going to rain, but how many of you are going to stand out in the rain anyways over the rest of the weekend to wait in line for Tron? You can do this for a one of a kind experience. </p> <p></p> <p>Do it for the fun. Do it for the joy. Do it for the boobies. Do it for the wieners. Do it for the music. Do it for the dancers. Do it for the booze. Do it for some or all of those reasons. But above all, do it to celebrate entertainment that celebrates everything that celebrates life, <b>that is the biggest fucking YES in the night to everything that spends all day telling you NO</b>, that you shouldn't enjoy debauched fun. </p> <p></p> <p>Fuck that. Come out. I'll be happy to see you, and honestly sad if I don't. Come and share this with me. </p> <p></p> <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

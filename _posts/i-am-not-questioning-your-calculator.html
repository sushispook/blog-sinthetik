I dont know what portal experiments are but perhaps it is why you are using more electricity than previously. Please call our toll free number on 1300 133 245 should you have any further enquiries about your account.<br /> </h5><h5 style="color: rgb(92, 93, 97); font-size: 11px; font-family: Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif; font-weight: normal; line-height: 15px; text-decoration: none; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> Sincerely, Allison Hayes<br /></h5><p /><strong>From:</strong> David Thorne<br /> <strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday 17 August 2010 11.04am<br /><strong>To:</strong> Allison Hayes<br /><strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Re: Ref. 28941739<p />Dear Allison,<br /><p /> Thank you for explaining that the amount correctly corresponds with a number you have based it on. I already called that telephone number and spoke to a robot for several minutes. While I&#39;m sure you receive a predominantly positive response from those hearing the term &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t get that, lets try that again&quot; repeated fifty times, I would rather be kicked in the head by a horse the size of ten horses all molded together into one big horse than dial that number ever again. It was incapable of directing me to the correct department despite my responding to each question with the word &#39;exterminate&#39; in a metallic voice.<br /> <p />During school holidays when I was about ten, I attempted to construct a robot from household appliances which included a blender, Atari 2600 and Vacuum cleaner. My intention was to have it completed before the holidays ended so that it could accompany me to school and kill Bradley McPherson who had stolen my Casio calculator watch. After realising that the project would entail actual engineering knowledge and being told to &quot;clean up that fucking mess in the shed&quot;, I instead told everyone at school that Bradley&#39;s mum had told my mum that he had been born with both a penis and a vagina and had to wear special underpants to keep the two separated.<br /> <p />I also constructed an electric sword around this time after viewing an episode of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century where they fought with such. Connecting an electric car antenna to the house mains and holding it with a garden glove, I tested it on my sister&#39;s cat. After dissembling the sword to hide all evidence and opening the windows in an attempt to air out the smell of burnt hair and cooked flesh, I buried (the appropriately named) Sooty in the backyard. A week later, during a family barbecue, the dog dug her up. <br /> <p />While I cannot go into too much detail regarding my portal experiments, due to the fact that AGL representatives would probably visit me and touch my stuff and say things like &quot;We are watching you buddy&quot;, I have attached a rough diagram which shows that more energy is produced than used, making it unlikely that this is why my account is five times its usual amount.<p />Regards, David.<p /></div></blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><a href="http://www.27bslash6.com/AGL.html">Click here to see the rest of the exchange</a></b>....</span>

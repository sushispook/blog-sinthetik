       <p>Seriously. I&#8217;m warning you at the outset here that this is a story that is both about sex, and is utterly disgusting. In fact, I&#8217;m just going to lift the author&#8217;s warning and place it right here: </p> <p></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>I can't be serious ALL the time, it's just no fun.&nbsp; I think part of getting people to accept fetishism as being a perfectly normal thing to involve oneself in, is to bring a sense of humour into it, where at all possible. </i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Do not eat, or drink whilst reading this.&nbsp; Put it down, now.&nbsp; </i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>I mean it.</i></p> <p></p> <p><b>If</b> you have no issues with explicit stories about sex, and <b>if</b> you can find humor in the disgusting, <b><a href="http://www.hotbutteredgun.com/2010/10/k-is-forepic-story-is-epic.html">then proceed to an epic story that is epic</a></b>.

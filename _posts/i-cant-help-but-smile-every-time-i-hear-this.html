When I was a kid, my Mom rented a bunch of Ernie Kovacs videos from the local store (Video Droid, for any of you who know where I&#39;m talking about). This would have been the late 80&#39;s, so it&#39;s not like it was topically accurate by any stretch of the imagination. But I totally fell in love with his work (especially Percy Dovetonsils), and I have super fond memories of hanging on the couch with the family, cracking up and watching his show. <p /><div><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jQ9TR3Y_r04?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></div><p /><div>I can&#39;t help but hear that theme and smile every single time. </div>

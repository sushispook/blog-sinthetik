       <p>... but for those of you that might not have seen this, you NEED to see this: </p> <p></p> <p><iframe allowfullscreen src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cTQNwMxqM3E?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p> <p></p> <p>Fair warning - NSFW audio. But worth bookmarking to watch when you get a chance. </p> <p></p> <p>It's a kick ass song with a wonderful message, sweet and awesome, and the post-script from the artist is something every single person should hear - and not just kids either, because sometimes we need someone else to tell us that it DID get better, and it's time we noticed it and celebrated it. </p>

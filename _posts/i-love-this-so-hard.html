        <p>There's a pin-up model by the name of <b><a href="http://fayedanielsbbw.blogspot.com/">Faye Daniels</a></b> who just kicks ass - and we're not even talking my opinion, this is a clear statement of fact (<b><a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/sushispook/pic/0051rzfg">do not dispute me</a></b>). Spend some time googling her name, and you'll see what she's all about (and oh hey almost certainly Not Safe For Work search results, folks). She took a moment to post an outtake from one of her photo shoots, which is, hands down, the most awesome thing I've seen on the internet all day: </p> <p></p> <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

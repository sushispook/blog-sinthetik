</p> <p></p> <p><i>Purple people eaters are so 1958! Forget them and say hello to your new alien overlord -- the most adorable green monster you ever saw, with a vibrating, voracious mouth of joy, form-fitting and curved to fit many penises. With an easy-grip body and three speeds (cycle through them by pushing on its belly), this little spaceguy is not a sleeve, but slides along the shaft. Add lube for even more out-of-this-world sensation--it's waterproof and easy to clean.</i></p>

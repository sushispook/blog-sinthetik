</p><p></p><p>I&#8217;m going to have to say HELL TO THE FUCKING YES. Because really, it&#8217;s the <i>afterlife</i>, right? We&#8217;re talking eternity. And given everything that the bible has gotten wrong, I think the odds are just as good that heaven and hell are about even, as far as fun versus shredding razors of not-fun go. </p><p></p><p>So, if we&#8217;re talking forever-and-ever-and-ever-amen here, I know I want my sweetie and I to end up at the party where there are people that, at the <b>very</b> least know how to get the fuck off (yes, double entendre intended). </p><p></p><p>Also, entendre intended is now my new band name. </p>

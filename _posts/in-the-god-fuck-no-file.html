      <p>I had tunnel vision strong as I offensively shoved my cart through Safeway this afternoon &#8211; the kind of tunnel vision you get after navigating the suddenly abandoned mid aisle cart, the oblivious aisle-drifters, and the people who forgot what they were doing midway through a 180 degree turn around in the produce section. I got through the checkout line, and weaved my way out towards the door past the &#8220;dining&#8221; area for deli patrons, when I saw a man flip open a pizza box, crack open a full bag of Cheetos (not the snack size either), and methodically dump it all over his pepperoni pizza, carefully spreading it out for even distribution. </p> <p></p> <p>I have an unfortunate affinity for junk food, but this horrifies even my inner 5 year old. Is this a thing? How do you get to a place like this? And GOD WHY would you do it in public where CHILDREN COULD SEE? </p>

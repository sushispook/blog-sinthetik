      <p><iframe allowfullscreen src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hbV6knbeUFE?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p> <p></p> <p>As much as this looks like it&#8217;s going to be some serious hardcore food pornography about my favorite cuisine ever, it also looks like it&#8217;s going to be severely depressing as well, showing a life that has room for almost nothing else. I can&#8217;t call it a life not lived, because that would be presumptuous and shitty of me to do so, but what I do see makes me think that it&#8217;s an unforgiving life. </p> <p></p> <p>Still, I&#8217;m likely going to watch it eventually &#8211; even if it&#8217;s not in theaters, then probably via Netflix when it inevitably gets released. </p>

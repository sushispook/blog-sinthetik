</p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.tmz.com/2012/01/26/paula-deen-diabetes-burger-cruise-photo/#.TyGmaONSTaj">FUCK EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS</a></b>. </p> <p></p> <p>To anyone sneering and joking about this, I&#8217;d like to ask the following: </p> <p class="MsoListParagraph" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">&middot;<span style="font: 7.0pt Times New Roman;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Are you her doctor &amp; know her current condition well? </p> <p class="MsoListParagraph" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">&middot;<span style="font: 7.0pt Times New Roman;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Are you able to telepathically/telekinetically read her blood glucose and hemoglobin a1c levels? </p> <p></p> <p>I don&#8217;t care if you think she has anything to answer for or not regarding her cooking. The woman is on vacation. You&#8217;re not her doctor. You can&#8217;t tell someone&#8217;s health by simply looking at them. Making fun of how people eat is how eating disorders get started in other people. </p> <p></p> <p>Do we remember Terry Schiavo? Remember how we all scoffed at Bill Frist&#8217;s amazing diagnosis of her simply through the television, and somehow knowing more than her ACTUAL FUCKING DOCTORS BY HER BEDSIDE? Does anyone see why I&#8217;m bringing this up? </p> <p></p> <p>Argue with me on this at your own peril. I&#8217;m absolutely enraged. </p>

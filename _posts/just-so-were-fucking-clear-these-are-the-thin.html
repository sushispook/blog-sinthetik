</p><p></p><p>An excellent compendium of statistics debunking so many of the myths around rape can be <b><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/hvfnf/things_that_cause_rape/c1ypfjv">found here</a></b>. </p><p></p><p>I hate that during initial interactions with women, I have to watch, flickering behind their eyes or words, the judgment of whether or not I&#8217;m dangerous. &nbsp;And as someone who gets along with women better than men, whose friends are almost entirely women, and whose interactions are mostly with women, I get to see this happen <b>a lot</b>. I am judged as to whether or not I could be someone who would justify violence based upon her clothing, behavior, or circumstance. And it&#8217;s slimy by association&#8230; but I don&#8217;t blame them one bit. </p><p></p><p>If you&#8217;re someone who is going to take issue or umbrage at this&#8230; don&#8217;t. Just close the browser window, turn around, and walk away. Have your rant elsewhere, because I have no time or patience for that sort of personage in my space. </p>

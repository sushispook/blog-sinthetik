<p>One of the worst things anyone can do is to deliberately make feel you helpless, especially after stringing you along. There are the big injustices, such as the Republicans trying to re-define rape &#8211; and after enough people called them out, they altered their course (although not enough &#8211; but that&#8217;s another entry). Then there&#8217;s <b><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/12/brooklyn-eyeware-merchant-arrested-after-cyber-bullying-customers-for-better-google-rankings.html">Vitaly Borker</a></b>, who deliberately shafted people so the multiple negative reviews would boost his page rankings &#8211; and got stomped for his hubris. And then, the whole <b><a href="http://gawker.com/5691681/the-internet-has-killed-cooks-source">Judith Griggs</a></b> plagiarism shenanigans &#8211; and now there&#8217;s a smoking crater where Cook&#8217;s Source used to be. And well, hey, <b><a href="http://blog.sinthetik.com/tag/tacticalcorsets">Tactical Corsets</a></b> &#8211; that&#8217;s all you guys. </p><p></p><p>All of these things have one thing in common &#8211; because they got brought into the light, word of mouth over the internet served to, at the very least, put a spanking on some hubristic assholes. </p><p></p><p>Those of you who are familiar with the concept of foreshadowing can probably see where this is going&#8230; My friend Sarah has, unfortunately, run afoul of one of these shitwizards. Here&#8217;s what happened in her own words: </p><p></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>A few months ago, my husband offered to get me a customized cell phone case for a Christmas present. After looking around at different sites, I settled on Lets Crystal It (<b><a href="www.letscrystalit.com">www.letscrystalit.com</a></b>) since I liked their designs the best. We picked one out, and I paid for it on my credit card since my husband doesn't have one. He picked up the tab, and I eagerly awaited my blingy new gift. </i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>The product was late arriving; even later than what was spelled out on the website. I'd been waiting weeks, so when my package arrived, I was very excited -- until I opened the box. What arrived was a sloppy, messy, incomplete product that had already been damaged in shipping. </i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>I had ordered a customized name plate with crystals on the front and back; there was nothing on the front, and the back looked like it was a lunch hour project from Kindergarten. The lettering was sloppy and crooked; there was a hole in the center of the case that wasn't pictured in the original product description -- and some of the crystals had already popped off BEFORE THE PACKAGE WAS EVEN OPENED!</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>I wrote the company and demanded a refund. They asked for pictures as evidence, which I supplied. The then said they would send a replacement. Based on their long turnaround and sloppy product, I didn't want a replacement, I wanted a refund. But when I asked for it again, they ignored me. Defeated, I asked how long it would take for a replacement. They said they'd send one at the end of the week. </i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Two weeks go by, and finally a get a notice that my item is being shipped. </i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>A week goes by. </i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>And then another. </i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>When I looked up the tracking number they gave me for USPS, it said &quot;the seller has notified us to expect a package. No further information is available.&quot;</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>No one answers my emails or messages left with the company's customer service line. </i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>After two weeks of nothing, I get an email saying &quot;we are tracking it. we will know tomorrow.&quot;</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>The next day rolls around, and no response. Now, any of you who've ever tracked a package know: you either know where it is, or you don't. It only takes a matter of seconds to determine a package's location, not days. </i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>I got another, single line email. No apologies or assurances, just: &quot;We are still tracking it.&quot;</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Also, the entire time they were ignoring my emails and phonecalls, they were updating their Twitter and Facebook pages. </i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Fed up, I send the following email: </i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>&quot;Have you found out where the package is? I need an update before end of day today or I will need to escalate this issue, seeing as it has now been two weeks since this package was allegedly sent.&quot;</i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>I get an immediate response: </i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><b><i>Don&#8217;t threaten us. If you are going to escalate, then go ahead. We are still tracking it. </i></b></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p><p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>WOW! How is THAT for customer service!</i></p><p></p><p>Luckily, her credit card company has refunded her money. They can, of course, immediately reply to an e-mail calling them out, but can get off their asses to mail out product (leaving alone that it might have been a macaroni picture, and not a customized cell phone). But other people? Not so fortunate: </p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">&middot;<span style="font: 7.0pt Times New Roman;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><a href="http://www.bbb.org/south-east-florida/business-reviews/general-merchandise-retail-by-internet/lets-crystal-it-in-pembroke-pines-fl-11012516">http://www.bbb.org/south-east-florida/business-reviews/general-merchandise-re...</a></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">&middot;<span style="font: 7.0pt Times New Roman;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><a href="http://www.bbb.org/south-east-florida/business-reviews/china-and-crystal-repair-services/lets-crystal-it-in-hollywood-fl-36000164">http://www.bbb.org/south-east-florida/business-reviews/china-and-crystal-repa...</a></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">&middot;<span style="font: 7.0pt Times New Roman;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><a href="http://www.bbb.org/south-east-florida/business-reviews/cellular-telephone-companies/lets-crystal-it-in-greenacres-fl-92020602">http://www.bbb.org/south-east-florida/business-reviews/cellular-telephone-companies/lets-crystal-it-in-greenacres-fl-92020602</a></p><p></p><p>So far, 11 registered complaints, and every last one was ignored. If you&#8217;re inclined, please re-post. Because seriously, that&#8217;s incredibly fucked up. </p>

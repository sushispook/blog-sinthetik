      <p><b><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-daniel-snyder/richard-floyd-transgender_b_1216713.html">HuffPo &#8211; Tennessee Lawmaker Threatens Trans Women with Violence</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>On Jan. 12 Tennessee State Representative Richard Floyd (R-Chattanooga) said he would &quot;stomp a mudhole&quot; into any transgender woman he saw attempting to use a women's restroom. That phrase means to sexually and violently assault someone to the point where they are unable to fight back.</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://pandagon.net/index.php/site/comments/dont-think-theyre-not-looking-to-impeachment">Padagon - Don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re not looking to impeachment</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>What's funny, of course, is that they just get more shrill about how they're the only &quot;real&quot; Americans when the people who have the markers of the tribe---white, Christian suburbanites who adhere to more traditional gender roles---are dwindling in numbers compared to the rest of us. Unfortunately, we need to realize that their panic over this is only going to make them more determined to impeach Obama the first chance they get on the thinnest of made-up charges. It's not like Republicans in Congress have anything better to do with their time. All they ever do is try to get more tax cuts for the wealthy and push anti-choice legislation. That's not really a full time job, giving congressional Republicans lots of time to concoct ways to impeach the President.</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2012/01/ocean-acidification-already-well-beyond-natural-variability.ars">Ars Technica - Ocean acidification already well beyond natural variability</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>The researchers emphasize that other factors&#8212;such as changes in light penetration, temperature, and nutrients&#8212;will be affecting marine ecosystems at the same time. (And acidification can affect more than just the calcareous critters.) The authors write, &#8220;These stress factors probably do not simply add up, but combine in a species-dependent manner. Tropical surface temperatures are projected to increase at a rate that would lead to massive coral bleaching and mortality in the next three to five decades. Combined with a detectable change due to reduced ocean aragonite saturation and the corresponding estimated drop in carbonate accretion of ~15 percent since the industrial revolution, severe reductions are likely to occur in coral reef diversity, structural complexity, and resilience by the middle of this century.&#8221;</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/01/meet-bill-gates">Wired - Meet Bill Gates, the Man Who Changed Open Source Software</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>But that afternoon was different. At the invitation of the company&#8217;s chief legal minds &#8212; Smith and Gutierrez &#8212; Ramji sat down with Gates, chief software architect Ray Ozzie, and a few others to discuss whether Microsoft could actually start using open source software. Ramji and Ozzie were on one side of the argument, insisting that Microsoft embrace open source, and Gutierrez offered a legal framework that could make that possible. But other top executives strongly challenged the idea.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Then Bill Gates stood up.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>He walked to the whiteboard and drew a diagram of how the system could work, from copyrights to code contribution to patents, and he said &#8212; in no uncertain terms &#8212; that the company had to make the move.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>For Ramji &#8212; who would spend more than three and a half years as the company&#8217;s chief open source strategist &#8212; the moment Bill Gates stood up was the moment Microsoft turned the corner on its approach to free software. &#8220;He was given little to no credit by the open source community &#8212; or anyone in the tech industry &#8212; for really understanding open source and why it can be important, how it can be a competitive advantage, and why when your competitors start to use it, you have to too. He really got it, and in that moment, he taught us all.&#8221;</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><b>Comment</b>: I find this article fascinating for two reasons. First off, the comments section is hilarious open-source-wankboy spew. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have a lot of love and respect for open source &#8211; but those comments are a stampede of KILL BILL comments with only the merest frosting of attempted relevancy or displayed comprehension of the article. Secondly, the title is technically correct &#8211; Bill Gates did change open source. He did it both by creating an OS ecosystem that open source was forced to react to, both in terms of open hostility and interoperability required to be relevant in the world. And he did it by spawning projects that have made a direct contribution. But by that same latter token, so has everyone who has contributed. </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b><a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/30/brits-deported-from-u-s-for-t.html">BoingBoing &#8211; Tourists deported from U.S. for Twitter jokes</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Two U.K. tourists landing in L.A. were detained and deported because of tweets joking about &quot;diggin' up&quot; Marilyn Monroe and &quot;destroying&quot; America.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>According to DHS paperwork, Leigh Van Bryan was matched to a &quot;One Day Lookout&quot; list, placed under oath, and ultimately denied entry and put on a plane back to Europe.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>&quot;[He wrote] on his tweeter[sic] website account that he was coming to the United States to dig up the grave of Marilyn Monroe,&quot; DHS officials wrote on his charge sheet. &quot;Also on his tweeter[sic] account Mr. Bryan posted that he was coming to destroy America.&quot;</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://purrversatility.blogspot.com/2012/01/safeward-safewords-and-battle-of.html">PurrVersatility - Safe/Ward, Safewords, and the Battle of Community Accountability</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>&quot;Nobody likes safewords&quot;. I find that an interesting attitude to have, personally. Because if even a community leader is saying that safewords are sucky, then that adds to the issue I want to talk about further- this attitude that being at a safe place where playing without a safeword is perhaps more intimate and more desirable. And if that is the attitude, does that not promote an unspoken attitude that while playing with safewords is important and safer, playing without them is desirable? Like with condoms- if you say &quot;everyone hates condoms, but, you know, they keep you safe. However, people who trust each other sometimes become fluid-bonded&quot;, you're not saying that condoms are bad, but you're saying that without condoms might well be better. I mean, I spend a lot of time people how to enjoy negotiating in a way that's both sexy and effective, and how to have hot safer sex discussions and practices- I think that making safer measures part of foreplay is an important aspect of this discussion. And hey, look at that, I like safewords and condoms. Coincidence? I think not.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><b>Comment</b>: This is an outgrowth over the discussion on <b><a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/01/29/real_abuse_in_bdsm/">this Salon article about what happens when safe words are ignored</a></b>.

Janet Howell (D-Fairfax) on Monday attached an amendment that would require men to have a rectal exam and a cardiac stress test before obtaining a prescription for erectile dysfunction medication.</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/4575/?single_page=true">The Atlantic &#8211; Have you ever tried to sell a Diamond</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Since the Ayer plan to romanticize diamonds required subtly altering the public's picture of the way a man courts -- and wins -- a woman, the advertising agency strongly suggested exploiting the relatively new medium of motion pictures. Movie idols, the paragons of romance for the mass audience, would be given diamonds to use as their symbols of indestructible love. In addition, the agency suggested offering stories and society photographs to selected magazines and newspapers which would reinforce the link between diamonds and romance. Stories would stress the size of diamonds that celebrities presented to their loved ones, and photographs would conspicuously show the glittering stone on the hand of a well-known woman. Fashion designers would talk on radio programs about the &quot;trend towards diamonds&quot; that Ayer planned to start. The Ayer plan also envisioned using the British royal family to help foster the romantic allure of diamonds. An Ayer memo said, &quot;Since Great Britain has such an important interest in the diamond industry, the royal couple could be of tremendous assistance to this British industry by wearing diamonds rather than other jewels.&quot; Queen Elizabeth later went on a well-publicized trip to several South African diamond mines, and she accepted a diamond from Oppenheimer. In addition to putting these plans into action, N. W. Ayer placed a series of lush four-color advertisements in magazines that were presumed to mold elite opinion, featuring reproductions of famous paintings by such artists as Picasso, Derain, Dali, and Dufy. The advertisements were intended to convey the idea that diamonds, like paintings, were unique works of art.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>In its 1947 strategy plan, the advertising agency strongly emphasized a psychological approach. &quot;We are dealing with a problem in mass psychology. We seek to ... strengthen the tradition of the diamond engagement ring -- to make it a psychological necessity capable of competing successfully at the retail level with utility goods and services....&quot; It defined as its target audience &quot;some 70 million people 15 years and over whose opinion we hope to influence in support of our objectives.&quot; N. W. Ayer outlined a subtle program that included arranging for lecturers to visit high schools across the country. &quot;All of these lectures revolve around the diamond engagement ring, and are reaching thousands of girls in their assemblies, classes and informal meetings in our leading educational institutions,&quot; the agency explained in a memorandum to De Beers. The agency had organized, in 1946, a weekly service called &quot;Hollywood Personalities,&quot; which provided 125 leading newspapers with descriptions of the diamonds worn by movie stars. And it continued its efforts to encourage news coverage of celebrities displaying diamond rings as symbols of romantic involvement. In 1947, the agency commissioned a series of portraits of &quot;engaged socialites.&quot; The idea was to create prestigious &quot;role models&quot; for the poorer middle-class wage-earners. The advertising agency explained, in its 1948 strategy paper, &quot;We spread the word of diamonds worn by stars of screen and stage, by wives and daughters of political leaders, by any woman who can make the grocer's wife and the mechanic's sweetheart say 'I wish I had what she has.'&quot;</i></p>

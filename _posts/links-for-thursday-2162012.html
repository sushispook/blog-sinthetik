      <p><b><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/spy-tech-companies-their-authoritarian-customers-part-i-finfisher-and-amesys">Spy Tech Companies &amp; Their Authoritarian Customers, Part I: FinFisher And Amesys</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>EFF recommended parliament approach the problem through a &#8220;know your customer&#8221; program whereby companies would investigate purchasers of surveillance technology and would refrain from doing business with a government or its agents if the sale would be used to assist in human rights abuses. This program would be voluntary for companies and encouraged via incentives but could, if necessary, become a formal requirement. As we&#8217;ve seen, transparency can be a powerful tool. The industry is notoriously secretive and a little sunlight can help spur protests and force companies to change their business practices. In the first part of a new series, EFF will take a look at what we know about some of the worst offenders located in Europe and the United States. Part I will highlight two companies, United Kingdom based FinFisher and France based Amesys.</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.alternet.org/newsandviews/article/789519/sick%3A_young%2C_undercover_cops_flirted_with_students_to_trick_them_into_selling_pot/">Young, Undercover Cops Flirted With Students to Trick Them Into Selling Pot</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>One day she asked Justin if he smoked pot. Even though he didn't smoke marijuana, the love-struck teen promised to help find some for her. Every couple of days she would text him asking if he had the marijuana. Finally, Justin was able to get it to her. She tried to give him $25 for the marijuana and he said he didn't want the money -- he got it for her as a present.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>A short while later, the police did a big sweep and arrest 31 students -- including Justin. Almost all were charged with selling a small amount of marijuana to the undercover cops. Now Justin has a felony hanging over his head.</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://christwire.org/2011/11/51-christian-friendly-words-for-male-masturbation/">51 Christian Friendly Words for Male Masturbation</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Kindling Satan&#8217;s wood</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>The demonic stroke</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Polishing the muzzle</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Richard&#8217;s death choke</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Mother&#8217;s fear</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Non-fetal Abortion</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Angering the cream volcano</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/jamie-oliver-unearths-joy-division-master-tapes,27390/">Jamie Oliver Unearths Joy Division Master Tapes</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>Late last year, leaders from Susan G. Komen for the Cure met to discuss their decision to end the breast health care funding received by one of the foundation's largest grantees. There were no findings of patient dissatisfaction, clinical errors, or financial mismanagement, but the decision was final: Patients seen in 2012 will be the last to receive Komen-funded care. Wondering why Komen will no longer support these lifesaving cancer screenings and breast health education sessions? Because they're provided by the highly trained doctors, nurses, and medical assistants at Planned Parenthood health centers.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>I hate compliments. I crave compliments. I fidget when you tell me I look nice, but I do like it: that&rsquo;s not an affectation so much as an unconscious reaction. When you compliment me, I feel like I need to correct you. When you don&rsquo;t compliment me, I wonder what I&rsquo;m doing wrong. I swear I&rsquo;m not trying to be difficult&mdash;this is just how my brain works. And there are some, uh, kinks in the system? Eh, I&rsquo;m not mechanical-minded enough to continue this analogy. I&rsquo;m writing this for a couple reasons: first, I like to navel gaze; and second, I find myself apologizing to people more and more often after they offer a compliment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t fishing for compliments.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s true. If I disparage myself, it&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s how I feel and sometimes I don&rsquo;t know when to keep my mouth shut. But as soon as I hear the standard response, the obligatory (but often sincere!) &ldquo;Hey, stop it, you&rsquo;re great,&rdquo; I know I&rsquo;ve done it again. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say that. Ugh, I didn&rsquo;t mean to make you feel like you had to.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>So what does this mean? Well, in order to change the &lsquo;sex&rsquo; designation on a Canadian Passport, the federal government requires proof that surgery has taken place, or will take place within one year. So for non-operative transgender persons, for gender nonconforming (genderqueer) persons, and for the vast majority of pre-operative transsexual persons, it is literally impossible to obtain proper travel documentation marked with the sex designation which &ldquo;matches&rdquo; the gender identity in which they live.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>In the eyes of the honourable Minister of Transportation, that makes trans people unfit to fly in Canada.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>A restaurant in Knoxville, Tennessee refused to serve state Sen. Stacey Campfield, the man who sponsored the state&rsquo;s &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say gay&rdquo; bill, compared homosexuality to bestiality, and most recently told Michelangelo Signorile that it&rsquo;s virtually impossible to spread HIV/AIDS through heterosexual sex. &ldquo;I hope that Stacy Campfield now knows what if feels like to be unfairly discriminated against,&rdquo; the Bistro at the Bijou wrote on its Facebook wall on Sunday. The restaurant has received an overwhelmingly positive response.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>My complaint isn't that attractive people are trying to get me to pay attention to their products. Rather, my point is that companies that rely on models whose various assets are stress-testing spandex or exposed to air are trying so hard that they fail. Not all attention is good, since it highlights to women attending the show that these products are not for them, as well as driving off men who find being so blatantly manipulated distasteful.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>The study reveals an important data point on the path from farm to fork, yet the source of the MRSA on meat products is unknown, Smith says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to figure out.&rdquo; Transmission of resistant bugs might occur between antibiotic-using and antibiotic-free operations, especially if they&rsquo;re near each other, or it could come from farm workers themselves. Another possibility is that contamination occurs at processing plants. &ldquo;Processing plants are supposed to be cleaned between conventional and organic animals,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But how well does that actually happen?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>For years now, the legacy entertainment industry has been predicting its own demise, claiming that the rise of technology, by enabling easy duplication and sharing -- and thus copyright infringement -- is destroying their bottom line. If left unchecked, they say, it is not only they that will suffer, but also the content creators, who will be deprived of a means to make a living. And, with artists lacking an incentive to create, no more art will be produced, starving our culture. While it seems obvious to many that this could not possibly be true, since creators and performers of artistic content existed long before the gatekeepers ever did, we've looked into the numbers to get an honest picture of the state of things. What we found is that not only is the sky not falling, as some would have us believe, but it appears that we're living through an incredible period of abundance and opportunity, with more people producing more content and more money being made than ever before. As it turns out... The Sky Is Rising!</em></p>

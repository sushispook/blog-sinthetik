      <p><b><a href="http://www.fatnutritionist.com/index.php/feeling-fat/">Feeling Fat</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>When my job (and my whole living situation) changed a little while back, I was thrown into body image crises I hadn&#8217;t experienced since my early 20s &#8211; hating the way I look. Feeling bad about my eating. Zero interest in moving my body. Weight gain.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>It is tempting, always so tempting, to rely on the panacea of dieting (or whatever term you like to give to intentional weight loss attempts) to fix these problems. Because, at least in the short term, it can. And when you&#8217;re feeling horrible RIGHT NOW, naturally, a quick fix is incredibly attractive.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Here&#8217;s how I deal with that urge: I allow myself to have these feelings.</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_you_could_get_sued_for_using_pinterest.php">How You Could Get Sued For Using Pinterest</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>The Boston Business Journal stopped using Pinterest one day after setting up its account after realizing it could be sued for images it uploaded to the site.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Web editor Galen Moore started playing around with the rapidly-growing social network on Thursday as a possible way to share the visual images that the Boston Business Journal uses in its coverage of real estate development: things like blueprints, artists conceptions and photos. But by Friday afternoon he had pulled the content after taking a careful read of Pinterest's user agreement and finding out the company reserves the right to sell images users upload.</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://open.salon.com/blog/sarah_gale/2012/02/19/why_rick_santorum_would_have_killed_my_daughter_1">Why Rick Santorum would have killed my daughter</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>If Rick Santorum had his way, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to get that test, and she most likely would have died. Because according to him, tests that give parents vital information about the health of their unborn children are morally wrong. Though he has no medical training, and no business commenting on the medical decisions that women and their doctors make, he argues that such tests shouldn&#8217;t be provided, or that employers at least should be allowed to opt out of paying for them on &#8220;moral grounds.&#8221;</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Eleven years ago,&nbsp; my husband and I had two kids and a mortgage, and like most young families we didn&#8217;t have $2,000 to pay for a test that my husband&#8217;s employer might object to on moral grounds.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>So, while Mr. Santorum may think that his blowhard opinions about when and where women should be allowed to have medical tests is righteous, I say it&#8217;s ignorance.</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rick-santorum-could-take-republicans-down-with-him/2012/02/20/gIQA8Af8PR_story.html">Rick Santorum could take Republicans down with him</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Given all the money Santorum has made as a Washington insider since leaving office, perhaps he forgets that most American families need two incomes just to put food on the table. The issue, for Republicans, is not just that Santorum would lose in November. It&#8217;s that he could be a drag on House and Senate candidates as well. Imagine, say, Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) trying to explain to his constituents why someone who doesn&#8217;t fully understand women&#8217;s participation in the workforce should be president.</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Listen closely and you can hear the anguished cries: &#8220;Mitch! Chris! Jeb! Help!&#8221;</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://borderhouseblog.com/?p=7832">Gamers Launch Harassment Campaign Against BioWare Writer</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>How the whole thing appears to have started is someone posted a combination of quotes from an interview from 2006 that doesn&#8217;t exist any more, as well as quotes that were entirely made up, on the gaming sub-Reddit in order to have a rant about how Hepler is &#8220;a cancer that is poisoning BioWare.&#8221; The thread was eventually deleted because of the attacks and the false attributions. But that wasn&#8217;t enough: angry gamers took to Twitter instead, harassing both Hepler and the people who offered support, and apparently even going so far as to make harassing phone calls to her home. Things escalated further when Hepler dared suggest that sexism played a part in the hatred. Right, and sexism played no part in the harassment of Jade Raymond, either, did it?</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>There&#8217;s a homophobic element to the attacks as well, with gamers (TW) accusing Hepler of &#8220;<b>screwing up Mass Effect by making Shepard gay</b>.&#8221;</i></p> <p></p> <p><b><a href="http://kotaku.com/5887064/biowares-boss-defends-harassed-writer">BioWare&#8217;s Boss Defends Harassed Writer</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>Yesterday we posted about Jennifer Hepler, one of BioWare's writers who has unfortunately been receiving a lot of hate over the Internet. Today BioWare's co-founder, Dr. Ray Muzyka, defended her (see statement above). In an effort to further support their employee, Muzyka posted that BioWare will be making a $1,000 donation in Hepler's name to Bullying Canada&#8212;an organization dedicated to helping young people through their struggles with bullying and victimization&#8212;and encourages others to support the effort.</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/whitneyjefferson/christina-hendricks-had-a-rough-time-in-high-schoo">Christina Hendricks Had A Rough Time In High School</a></b>:</p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>&quot;My school days were pretty unhappy. I had the worst high school experience ever. I went to a very mean school and was bullied like crazy. I was a bit of a goth with purple hair and I was also part of the drama group, so my friends and I were all weird theatre people and everyone just hated us. There was a long corridor with lockers on either side and kids would sit on top of them and spit on you. It was like something out of Lord of the Flies. I was a goth kid. I dyed my hair about 42 different colours, shaved it at the back and wore black make-up. Kids can be pretty judgmental about people who are different. But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy. My mother was mortified and kept telling me how horrible and ugly I looked. Strangers would walk by with a look of shock on their face, so I never felt pretty. I just always felt awkward.&quot;</i></p>

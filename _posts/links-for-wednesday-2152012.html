<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>"Earlier in the election, I was completely oblivious as to who Rick Santorum was, but when the dude went home to be with his daughter when she was sick, that was very commendable,&rdquo; Mustaine recently told MusicRadar.com.&nbsp; &ldquo;... You know, I think Santorum has some presidential qualities, and I'm hoping that if it does come down to it, we'll see a Republican in the White House... and that it's Rick Santorum."</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><strong>Comment</strong>: Wow, really? Because Rick Santorum would make the reasons why you wrote the protest song about the PMRC look like a slightly stubbed toe. Alternately, I can sum up my response thusly:</p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>One thing I want to point out right away which is very illuminating, if highly disturbing, about what Heartland allegedly wants to do: they are considering developing a curriculum for teachers to use in the classroom to sow confusion about climate change. I know, it sounds like I&rsquo;m making that up, but I&rsquo;m not. In this document they say:</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.0in;"><em>[Dr. Wojick's] effort will focus on providing curriculum that shows that the topic of climate change is controversial and uncertain &ndash; two key points that are effective at dissuading teachers from teaching science.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>There&rsquo;s a term in the field of psychology called disavowal, which means that you know something &ndash; but at the same time, you don&rsquo;t let yourself know that you know it!&nbsp; In other words, you disavow the thing that&rsquo;s too hard to consciously acknowledge. When it comes to the failure of diets, disavowal occurs not only for individuals, but at the cultural level as well.&nbsp; Think about how many times we hear a report that diets don&rsquo;t work, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s still good to keep trying,&rdquo; or a finding that people can be healthy in higher BMI ranges, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s still probably a good idea to lose some weight.&rdquo;&nbsp; These cultural messages to lose weight despite the lack of evidence for efficacy seep into the individual&rsquo;s psyche, making it all the more difficult for people like Beth to move toward acceptance.</em></p>

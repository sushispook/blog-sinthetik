</p> <p></p> <p><b>Everyone</b>, and I mean <b><i>Everyone</i></b> should do a tour of duty in the foodservice industry. Doesn&#8217;t matter what part &#8211; you&#8217;ll see enough to know just how much hard work it is to provide you with a meal, the razor-thin margins, and how little they get paid. Unless you received absolutely horrible service (and if you did, why didn&#8217;t you just walk out?), leave a tip. If you&#8217;re going to be even a semi-regular somewhere, <b><i>leave a fucking tip</i></b> &#8211; not only are you helping your server make an acceptable wage, you&#8217;re investing in a relationship. You&#8217;re showing them that you are a conscientious person, and you know what? You&#8217;ll get treated well because you&#8217;re remembering that the people making it all happen are human beings who want a level of dignity and respect, just like you &#8211; and working in foodservice is one of the best ways to learn that lesson, and start approaching every interaction with this concept as a part of it.</p> <p></p> <p>Plus, tip your favorite bartender and server well and often, and they will take care of you. And you&#8217;ll make a friend in the bargain, I assure you. </p>

       <p>I have a proud history of watching some <i>seriously</i> stank-ass horror/sci-fi movies. Scripts that never should have been submitted as some film student&#8217;s final, let alone had any sort of funding applied to it by anyone, at all&#8230; Movies so horrible, that both my sister and I, suffering from the flu, both agreed that it MUST have been a shared fever hallucination, because there was just <i>no fucking way</i> anyone would make a serious film about fire-farting cockroaches&#8230;</p> <p></p> <p><iframe allowfullscreen src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gk35zer0T10?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p> <p></p> <p>&#8230; and yet, we found out that it really did happen. </p> <p></p> <p>But good god, the crapitude was awesome &#8211; the amount of disbelief that the filmmakers required us to suspend was directly proportional to our levels of hilarity. Oh, the things I&#8217;ve seen&#8230;</p> <p></p> <p>Sci-Fi (I refuse to use that <b>other</b> name) has produced, or been affiliated with some pretty awful stinkers. Some fun, some neat, but mostly just unwatchable because they&#8217;ve actually got actors acting, as opposed to my buddy who works at the convenience mart to cough out a few lines of a script. As such, it&#8217;s just painful, and no fun. </p> <p></p> <p>Happily, some poor deluded fuck has taken that classic formula of no budget, actors who were whisked away from the nearest arcade, barstool, or tanning salon, and most importantly&#8230; the notion that this is <b>SERIOUS FILMMAKING</b>&#8230;</p> <p></p> <p><iframe allowfullscreen src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YnNvBucoNSY?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p> <p></p> <p>That horror? Birdemic &#8211; where crazed bald eagles suddenly attach the populace of San Jose, CA. </p> <p></p> <p>Really.</p> <p></p> <p>Seriously. Watch the trailer. I&#8217;m not kidding. <b>Yes</b>, you did really see the shittiest CGI birds ever committed to film. Watch it again if you think I&#8217;m lying. </p> <p></p> <p>Hats off to you, mister James Nguyen &#8211; you really do honestly believe that turds can shine like diamonds. And until you figure out otherwise, we&#8217;ll all have a damned good chuckle. </p>

<p>Techno can be accused of a lot of things - being unoriginal and often derivative is definitely one of them. But often stupidly, cheesetastically relentlessly positive is another. While slaving away at a movie theater, I would often listen to this song while taking my breaks to remind me that the people I was forced to deal with on a regular basis were not the sum total of humanity. It's completely and dorkily upbeat. And I found that more often than not, people would ask me for a copy of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amusingly enough, the b-side on this super-cheerful single? A cover of Joy Division's "New Dawn Fades". Heh.</p>
<p />
<div>Also, I would jokingly call this the Calgon Song.&nbsp;</div>

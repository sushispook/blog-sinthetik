       <p>I am rather keenly aware that the content here as been&#8230; well, shall we say <i><a href="http://blog.sinthetik.com/tag/goodnightmoon">lunar-centric</a></i> as of late. And while I by no means feel that there is any reason to apologize for that, I hope to actually get a few actual blog posts out the door in the next week or so &#8211; I&#8217;ve got several snippets which I think could be the genesis of some interesting rants. </p> <p></p> <p>I am write-once-post-immediately blogger, and I write when a particular subject or item gets underneath my skin and I have to furiously scratch away at it with words until itchytime stops. That itch obeys no regular schedule, phase of the moon, or any other cycle that I have able to distill from the ether, but there are, shall we say, some promising bug-bites. And we&#8217;ll leave it at that for tonight. </p> <p></p> <p>Also, go fucking vote tomorrow. Because democracy is <i>sexy</i>. </p>

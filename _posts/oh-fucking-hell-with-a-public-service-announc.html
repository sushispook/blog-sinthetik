       <p>A Preface</p> <p></p> <p>I tend not to be comfortable with any militant <i>&#8211;ism</i>. From my own personal experience, I know that confrontational tactics simply entrench my negative attitude towards a given subject matter, regardless of how closely it may line up with my own moral or ethical code. The older I&#8217;ve gotten, the more I have tried to weave this into my interactions with people, saving true wrath for when scorched earth is the last recourse. And as a point of fact, I hate getting angry, because it&#8217;s a long road before I get angry &#8211; often farther than it takes other people. Not <b>annoyed</b>, but pure fury &#8211; and because it takes a long time to get there, people often make the mistake of assuming this is a limitless supply of patience. </p> <p></p> <p>This is wrong. It also means when I get angry, I get far angrier, and the size of that anger gets so huge that it requires a great deal of time to process all of it. And if there is a particular cause where arguing against it is to strike at the heart of me, then, at long last, I will be militant in self defense. </p> <p></p> <p>And, as I&#8217;ve mentioned elsewhere, <b><a href="http://blog.sinthetik.com/it-could-be-worse-you-could-be-fat">I have a problem with fat-hate</a></b>. So, if you feel compelled to tell me I&#8217;m wrong, or argue a point that ultimately places me in the role of a second-class citizen, then here&#8217;s some advice: </p> <p></p> <p><b><i>Shut the fuck up and move on</i></b>. Really. If proving a point to win an argument wherein I discuss the scientifically researched way that I have chosen to live my life (as validated by <b>both</b> of my GP doctors), then go. Just go, and don&#8217;t come back. And you do not get to call yourself my friend, <b>especially</b> doubly so &#8211; because holy fuck, that tells me so much about what you must think of me that you&#8217;ve left unsaid. </p> <p></p> <p>And if this philosophy drives you to argue with me in spite of all of that, then I would ask you to consider your real motivations, and your own prejudices, that you would argue something to the point of seriously hurting the feelings of a friend. Because, in my book, that is far <b>far</b> more fucked up and terrible than failing to line up with any particular aesthetic of beauty, because you have failed the test of what I consider to be baseline human decency.</p> <p></p> <p>I am a militant, uppity fat-ass. If you have a problem with that, you know where the door is, since you came through it. </p> <p></p> <p>Now, having said that, on to the &#8220;Oh FUCKING HELL&#8221; portion&#8230;</p> <p></p> <p><iframe allowfullscreen src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cp-qLGSeXus?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p> <p></p> <p>This is footage of a walking &#8220;advertisement&#8221; for a &#8220;beauty&#8221; clinic in Estonia, with one girl portraying &#8220;before&#8221;, and one &#8220;after&#8221;. Putting aside the pervasively awful notions of how one must obtain conventional beauty at all costs&#8230;.</p> <p></p> <p>&#8230;. the fuck? Seriously? The &#8220;After&#8221; girl has her skeleton stretched and her entire bone structure altered? God, the Spanish Inquisition was so <b><i>forward</i></b> thinking with employing the rack!</p>

<p>Let's just be honest here... this movie was completely pants:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great idea - what lurks on the other side of punching through the universe via a black hole? Apparently Sam Neil's breakdown as barely propped up by anemic script writing and a rather literal interpretation of <em>Deus Ex Machina</em>. Also, if it wasn't for this movie, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fun-Knives-Velvet-Acid-Christ/dp/B00000ID37">this entire album would likely cease to exist</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In between Sam Neil trying to pull off evil, and waiting for the end that was telegraphed from the beginning of the movie, I did enjoy bits and pieces of the soundtrack - so I pleased, but not surprised, to find that Orbital had teamed up with Dean Kamen on the soundtrack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that this is the music played during a scene where the volume of blood gave that elevator bit in The Shining a run for its money, this definitely meets the criteria. Enjoy!</p>

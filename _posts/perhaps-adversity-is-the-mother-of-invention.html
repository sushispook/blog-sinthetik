</p> <p></p> <p>This is Sherri Williams, the owner of <b>Pleasures</b>, a &quot;romance boutique&quot;. Sherri has <b><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=5406177">continued to fight Alabama's ridiculous ban on sex toys</a> </b>for over ten years. She's still working with the ACLU to fight the good fight, but has gone one step further: She has opened <b><a href="http://blog.al.com/breaking/2010/11/alabama_sex_toy_drive-thru.html">the nation's first adult shop to offer drive-through service</a></b>. </p> <p></p> <p>I kind of really love this, because it just kicks so much ass. </p>

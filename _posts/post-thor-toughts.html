<p>So we watched Thor, and first, above all else, I must say this: </p><p></p><p>Chris Hemsworth, you are a magnificent hunk of man-steak, and I salute you, sir. </p><p></p><p>I'm really funny about what I'll suspend my disbelief over... Thor was acceptable, because it was all about mythology and deities. There's no real defined logic about that, so I'm cool with it. And Star Trek works, because even though they flub stuff like sound in a vacuum, it's still a universe that's clearly built up out of logic and order. Yes, they can do crazy stuff, but it's clearly machinery that someone had to build and it fucks up and breaks and people need to fix it. And that's the other end of it for me. </p><p></p><p>Where it fails for me is in the middle. </p><p></p><p>During the preview for the Green Lantern, I just wanted to sardonically snicker, and it's a wonder I didn't make myself dizzy from rolling my eyes so much. There's a ring and you can imagine shit and it happens. Okay, that's the sort of logic that I can accept when we're also pretending that my Casio G-Shock watch can actually shoot missiles and the sidewalk is lava. </p><p></p><p>&quot;He can shoot webbing because he was big by a radioactive spider? FUCK YOU&quot;, says my sense of disbelief. </p><p></p><p>Anyways, I get the feeling that there was a lot more &quot;connective tissue&quot; to the script that got cut out. I rather hope there's a redonkulously long director's cut that gets into it a bit more, as certain actions and feelings by major characters seemed suddenly bent to awkwardly move the plot along. It's not a bad movie - it's stupidly fun and I'm curious to see what comes next.</p>

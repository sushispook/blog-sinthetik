</p> <p></p> <p>Upon visiting his local Costco, Rob Cockerham was struck with the realization that all of the Costco price labels were generic pieces of white paper using the same fonts that virtually anyone with a PC has access to. It didn&#8217;t take long for the wheels of mischief to turn in his head, and he quickly <b><a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/pranks/costco/costco1.php">printed up a batch of fake labels</a></b> to ensure that hilarity would ensue. </p> <p></p> <p>I am rather sad that Costco doesn&#8217;t <i>actually </i>carry a &#8220;Vinyl Dungeon Restraint System&#8221;. </p>

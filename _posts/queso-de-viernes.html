</p> <p></p> <p>I'm looking at my CD of this album. The read surface is dusted with micro-scratches everywhere - no deep pits, but definitely the kind anyone who used a portable CD player in the 90's/early 00's saw form on all of their favorite discs. And before I had a portable CD player, I had several cassette tape copies that were eventually devoured by the tape deck in my car and walkman. <b>Well-loved</b> definitely describes how much I enjoyed this album when it came out in 1995. </p> <p></p> <p>The opening song, <i>Release the Pressure</i> didn't grab me at first... I didn't really enjoy the reggae-inspired vocals or pacing - I was all about faster and more electronic stuff. But more often than not I'd toss this disc in and press play at work, and get distracted, listening to this song over and over again... and I found myself humming pieces of it, and playing little loops of it in my head over and over again. It may not be my favorite song - but it's a great song from a band I absolutely loved during the peak of my techno music phase. </p> <p></p> <p>Hope you enjoy it - I think it's a good way to start the weekend. </p> </div>   <p></p><p><div class='p_embed p_audio_embed'>

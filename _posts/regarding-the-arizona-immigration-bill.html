Seth Myers puts it thusly:<p /><object height="289" width="500"><param name="movie" value="http://www.hulu.com/embed/I7xO2wVWxeu4-bW6M9ECsw" /></param><param name="flashvars" value="ap=1" /></param><embed src="http://www.hulu.com/embed/I7xO2wVWxeu4-bW6M9ECsw" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="289" flashvars="ap=1" width="500"></embed></object><p /><div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <i>This week, Arizona signed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country which will allow police to demand identification papers from anyone they suspect is in the country illegally. I know there’s some people in Arizona worried that Obama is acting like Hitler, but could we all agree that there’s nothing more Nazi than saying &quot;Show me your papers?&quot; There’s never been a World War II movie that didn’t include the line &quot;show me your papers.&quot; It’s their catchphrase. Every time someone says &quot;show me your papers,&quot; Hitler’s family gets a residual check. So heads up, Arizona; that’s fascism. I know, I know, it’s a dry fascism, but it’s still fascism.</i></div>

</p><p></p><p>The one where you try to squeeze out all the particles of shame for the press that you can, even going so far as to mash your mouth shut, compressing your lips to a small, purplish line. You know, that one. </p><p></p><p>My problem here is this: What, exactly, did he do wrong? Texting your junk over twitter unsolicited is dumb, but it doesn&#8217;t contravene any of his political planks. In that vacuum of reason, people try to say &#8220;Oh, but his poor wife!&#8221;&#8230; and you know what? <b>Fuck you</b>, because you just don&#8217;t know. </p><p></p><p>The assumption I see all over the place is that he&#8217;s the low-down dirty cheating snake, because how else could it possibly be? Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if we at least had one representative or politician who would stand up and, by example, inject a positive view of non-monogamy into the national consciousness? I find it monstrously presumptuous that there&#8217;s the assumption he hid all of this from his wife. Maybe he did &#8211; and maybe they&#8217;d already discussed this. It could be very possible that the real charade we&#8217;re watching here is the dog and pony show made in front of the cameras, because having consensual and respectful non-monogamous interactions as normative is the worse threat than &#8220;cheating&#8221;. </p><p></p><p>We know that he didn&#8217;t actually do anything other than send ill-considered pictures. And he&#8217;s never attempted to legislate morality. And meanwhile, while every time we open our wallets we find our money is on fire and soylent corporation is made of PEOPLE, yo, so really, I&#8217;d like to fucking know: </p><p></p><p><b>This all matters HOW, exactly? </b></p>

</p> <p></p> <p>If you&#8217;re in the bay area, and you have no plans, YOU NEED TO BE HERE. Meshuggah Beach Party &#8211; Hacidic Surf Rock Guitar &#8211; is one of the most fun live musical shows I&#8217;ve ever seen. There will be gorgeous and talented performers shaking it for <b>your </b>pleasure. And so what if it rains? What&#8217;s raises the temperature of your blood better than alcohol and scantily-clad men and women? </p> <p></p> <p>Come on out &#8211; live entertainment is one of the most wonderful experiences out there, and it keeps culture alive (and talent fed and housed!). If you support fun, vote with your feet and <b>come on out</b>. And if you&#8217;d rather see another pottery barn or similar analogue, then vote with your ass by sitting on it and letting NAKED FUN pass you by. </p> <p></p> <p>I hope to see y&#8217;all there!</p>

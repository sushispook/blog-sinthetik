<p>Two things here....</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style=""><span style="">1)<span style="font: 7.0pt Times New Roman;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Let's just say I'm not svelte. And I can tell you that I have had my fair share of Kettle-brand chips, and unless suddenly being attracted to the same sex feels just like greasy regret and salty bloat, then I think we can shoot this one down. Besides, being suddenly attracted to the same sex feels exactly like a sugar-crash after eating 3 pints of cherry garcia (SORRY HOMOS BUT THIS ONE WOULD HAVE OUTED SOONER OR LATER)</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style=""><span style="">2)<span style="font: 7.0pt Times New Roman;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the government is turning us gay, then aren't the queerest and most flaming then the most patriotic amongst us? They're not homos, THEY'RE FREEDOM-FAGS!</p>

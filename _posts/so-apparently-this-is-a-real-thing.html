</p><p></p><p>There are no plans to bring this game to the US &#8211; it&#8217;s Europe only at the moment. I&#8217;m sure that Ubisoft had a moment where they discussed it with their legal and marketing departments, and realized that the hysteria surrounding it would far exceed any bump in sales from the press, and there would be a slew of ridiculous lawsuits where people claim they got teen-pregnant because the evil game made them do it. </p><p></p><p>In all honesty, it seems <i>mostly</i> harmless from the ad copy (save for the above gripe regarding weight). I&#8217;m curious to see how it sells, and I wonder if this is the first teeny-tiny crack in the door of more adult games with motion controls. Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony are usually pretty prudish, so it surprises me that this is coming to market, albeit just in Europe. But it&#8217;s inevitable &#8211; and we can all look forward to horrid XXX shovelware and a roped-off &#8220;adults only&#8221; back corner in the video game stores, just like the days of old when you wanted to rent a VHS of porn. </p>

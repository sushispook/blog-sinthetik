<p>The thing that&#39;s been really fun about doing Friday Cheese is re-listening to all this old stuff where some of it is completely mired in whatever the sound-du-jour was in the rave scene at the time, and what was actually polished and somewhat original. The Prodigy has definitely still hung on, mostly because Liam&#39;s got his own sound and what he likes. But man, the early stuff? Listening to this one, you can imagine the glow sticks, whistles, and giant cartoony hats.Â </p>

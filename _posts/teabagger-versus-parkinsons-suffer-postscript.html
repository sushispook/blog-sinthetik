<p>Remember that Tea Party protest <strong><a href="http://blog.sinthetik.com/the-politics-of-fear-and-hate-are-alive-and-t" target="_blank">where they humiliated and harassed that Parkinson&rsquo;s sufferer</a></strong>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, <strong><a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/03/24/dollar-bill-throw.html?sid=101" target="_blank">at least one Teabagger who took part is sorry</a></strong>. And honestly? I, for one, believe him. I can&rsquo;t lay my hands on the exact quote, or from which Discworld book it came from, but Terry Pratchett&rsquo;s take on mobs is perfect: That a person is capable of rational and reasonable thought &ndash; but a mob is a big, dumb, stupid panicky animal. What we saw was one man caught up in the mind of the mob.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when I wish that pundits would stop blowing hot air, that we&rsquo;d all stop pretending that two journalistic wrongs somehow restore impartial integrity to the press, that we&rsquo;d all stop yelling talking points at each other, this is why.</p>

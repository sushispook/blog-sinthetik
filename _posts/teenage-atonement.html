       <p>So, apparently <b><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2010/10/20/national/a183506D62.DTL&amp;tsp=1">Bob Guccione died</a></b>. I&#8217;ll spare everyone the whole &#8220;In my day we didn&#8217;t have the internet for wanking&#8221; speech that I&#8217;m sure everyone <i>else</i> is going to make. But I couldn&#8217;t help but recall a story&#8230;</p> <p></p> <p>As I recall, I was 14 years old, and at a friend&#8217;s house over the weekend. We ended up getting high, and as sometimes happens, weird frames of mind will suddenly take hold. And suddenly, my friend decided that pornography was evil, denigrating to women, and he wasn&#8217;t going to suffer its presence in his room for any longer.</p> <p></p> <p><i>(Keep in mind that we grew up in Marin County &#8211; I&#8217;m not saying he was right or wrong, but these attitudes tended to be taken to the extreme)</i></p> <p></p> <p>So, in the middle of the night, still fairly well baked, we walked the streets throughout his neighborhood, looking for cars with windows open. And in went a penthouse or a playboy. The next morning, around 2 dozen car owners came out of their homes to come to a good morning treat. I just couldn&#8217;t help but wonder how many arguments, laughs, or awkward conversations we caused. </p>

Kids are gonna find ways to be different while they figure out who the fuck they are, and at least it sounds like they&#39;re getting some slack about it.</div> <p /><div>On the other hand, if you tell me your a werewolf OR a vampire, I&#39;m getting the goddamn hose, and it may be hooked up to a high-pressure tank of hot salsa. </div><p /><div>Personally, I&#39;m waiting for teenage mummies. </div>

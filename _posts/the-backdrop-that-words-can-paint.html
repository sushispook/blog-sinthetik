       <p>Thanks to <b><a href="http://www.hotbutteredgun.com/">Hot Buttered Gun</a></b> for sharing this &#8211; &#8220;<b><a href="http://heresycorner.blogspot.com/2010/10/language-of-prostitution-or.html">The language of prostitution, or the prostitution of language</a></b>&#8221;. It&#8217;s a great treatise on framing a debate based upon the descriptors used. While it&#8217;s primarily focused on those for and against the sex worker industry, it also serves as a reminder as to how an agenda can set the tone of a discussion in a way that, if unchallenged, tilts a discussion towards a pre-conceived narrative. </p> <p></p> <p>This is a particularly touchy area for me, because as someone who has friends that currently are, or have been sex workers, I am very sensitive to the concept of slut-shaming - <b><i>especially</i></b> as it applies to this profession. Without exception, they are all not only fantastically wonderful people, but deeply honorable and compassionate. To see them reduced to caricatures is&#8230; well, &#8220;a bit vexing&#8221; doesn&#8217;t quite cover it. If it isn&#8217;t about saving the children, it&#8217;s about saving us from ourselves, and quite frankly &#8211; I don&#8217;t need saving. </p> <p></p> <p>And neither do they. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the last one for Friday-not-cheese for awhile. It&#39;s completely appropriate, as it&#39;s a song that I&#39;ve always associated with the beginning of Fall, watching the leaves change and that first bite in the air. </p><p /><div>It&#39;s also from a video game, Silent Hill 3. And while it was not the best in the series (that would be Silent Hill 2, which was a frightening, touching, and sad story about love, the incredible capacity for self-deception, and redemption, and how it would play out in a world that conformed itself to your darkest and worst thoughts), this is an amazing song that I have always loved deeply. Like any good song that&#39;s used as a soundtrack, it paints a wonderful background in your head, letting you tell your own story with your own thoughts. </div>

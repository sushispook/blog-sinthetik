       <p>To John Boehner and the rest of the republicans... I would like to quote this relevant passage from the movie Aliens:</p> <p></p> <p style="text-indent: .5in;">&quot;You had your chance, Gorman&quot;. </p> <p></p> <p>You had <i>years</i> to set this right. Don't bleat sanctimoniously about the burden upon the tax payer while your party's president presided over the greatest growth of the deficit in our nation&#8217;s history, and the launch of a war that shamed our nation and continuous to drain precious dollars from our budget like a fat tick. Don&#8217;t you fucking <b>dare</b> grandstand and state that the institution of democracy is shamed &#8211; not when your party did everything they could to sabotage this simply so it wouldn&#8217;t happen under the watch of a democratic president. </p> <p></p> <p>You&#8217;re right &#8211; it&#8217;s not a perfect piece of legislation. You speak the truth that no one agrees that this is a bill that covers all of the bases. But that&#8217;s democracy &#8211; it is a rarity that everyone shouts in one voice, and marches to one drum beat. As we are a nation of many, so are our viewpoints &#8211; and compromise should never be cast around as an epithet, haunted with darkness and evil. No, that&#8217;s the time when we shine. Of <b>course</b> it&#8217;s not perfect &#8211; but if we strived for nothing less than perfection in every single effort, we would be weighted down with self-imposed failure. </p> <p></p> <p>So what have you done? You have taken the justified fear of a nation and whipped it into a frenzy for callous, personal ends, with no heed paid towards the long term damage to this nation. Am I afraid? I am <i>terrified</i> that this will not work as planned. But we haven&#8217;t any other options&#8230;</p> <p></p> <p>&#8230; you&#8217;ve seen to that. </p> <p></p> <p>So what happens now? We&#8217;ll see. I hope that this works out &#8211; not because I want to self-righteously crow at your defeat, but because I want people to stop hurting. So in the same way that the republican party exhorted everyone of all stripes to get behind a war, it&#8217;s time to get behind taking care of <b>us</b>, of we the people. </p> <p></p> <p>And now we see what happens. </p>

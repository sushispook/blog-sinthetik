<p>... the more forgiving and empathetic I tend to be about the excesses of today's youth when it comes to fashion. Why? Because holiest of shitballs, have I ever made some atrocious mistakes... and besides, in a society where everything is so commercialized and commoditized, sometimes it takes some amazing leaps of fashion-gymnastics to express yourself in a non-contrived way when you really get The Itch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then there are times when it's on my front lawn and it needs to get off, or else it gets the shotgun.&nbsp;</p>

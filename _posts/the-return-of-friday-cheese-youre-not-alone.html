<p>Chumbawamba&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tubthumping&rdquo; single so solidly landed them in the 90&rsquo;s cheese category that I know many people never listened to anything else they did. And were it not for my roommate at the time insisting to everyone and anyone that would listen that they were so much more than just that single, that the entire album was an entire collection of really excellent pop music, I never would have heard this song.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently re-discovered this album, and had forgotten about the song &ldquo;Outsider&rdquo;. Now, more than ever, it seems incredibly relevant and powerful in a world where so many people are disenfranchised from everything their peers/family hold dear, leaving them feeling unanchored and alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not alone. You&rsquo;re <strong>never</strong> alone &ndash; here and now, we have so many resources to help those that are hurting.</p>

</p> <p></p> <p>&#8230; is that this is where all the best artists are, the fun people who always the ones with you when you just want to burst with glee over how AWESOME the world is, the nicest people &#8211; because they&#8217;ve been to hell-on-earth and know that the best thing you can do is be nice to people and have fun. In the fiery depths of hell, we have the best bartenders and the maddest chefs that make the most delicious food you&#8217;d ever had, and you can share both the food and the booze and come to know that if heaven isn&#8217;t even half as truly fun as hell, then the Devil has only to put his feet up and welcome everyone in. </p> <p></p> <p>After all, they&#8217;re the ones making it a jumpin&#8217; joint.  </p> <p></p> <p><i>Via <b><a href="http://postmodsexgeek.tumblr.com/post/10280893387/nezua-mariposaroja-hellokidazer-fuck">PostModSexGeek</a></b> who you&#8217;re clicking on and reading right now, right? </i></p>

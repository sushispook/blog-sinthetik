<p>I hold the opinion that the best comedy is born out of keen insight into the soul. The hardest laughs I have had have come from the discomfort of finding an uncomfortable truth held up in all of its naked ridiculousness. And comedians who wield this skill well may be damaged souls, but they often are truly good souls. </p><p></p><p>Today marks the passing of someone who has had me red-cheeked and nearly oxygen-starved with laughter on many occasions&#8230; someone who has been a big part of <b><a href="http://www.hubbahubbarevue.com/">my favorite church in the world</a></b>&#8230; and someone who was clearly, and quite simply, a good soul. </p><p></p><p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</p><p></p><p>Honestly, knowing that I&#8217;m never going to have you wreck me with helpless laughter with a masterfully timed crude zinger or to see you leaning at the side of the stage with the look of &#8220;holy crap, I&#8217;m getting away with this&#8221;&#8230; well it blows all the goats everywhere, and every<b>when</b>. All goats that ever were, are, or will be, fellated across the vast chasm of time. </p><p></p><p>I don&#8217;t have to hope that you&#8217;re yukking it up in the afterlife, because I <b>know</b> you are already. </p>

To suspend your disbelief over a a marauding alien is much more difficult (despite Ridley Scott and James Cameron making it look effortless) than the horror of the absolutely familiar, even personal. The idea of zombies is frightening simply because it makes you consider the concept of having everything you know and find comfort in transformed into the terrible - and that, to me, is &lt;i&gt;infinitely&lt;/i&gt; more frightening.Â </div> <p /><div>Plus, the zombie apocalypse idea plays directly to my love of abandoned cityscape imagery.</div>

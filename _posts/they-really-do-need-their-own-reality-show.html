       <p>So, on Sunday, <b><a href="http://www.sparklydevil.com/">two of my favorite people</a></b> got married - and they did in on their terms, showing exactly why I adore them. The ceremony was perfectly <i>them</i>, a distilled down and pure example of their sense of humor, style, and love for eachother. And, one of the performances that night was an operatic reading of some of the groom's more <i>piquant</i> quotes: </p> <p></p> <p><iframe allowfullscreen src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/N-TeM5tBuOA?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p> <p></p> <p>Very much NOT safe for work audio - but OH GOD so worth putting the headphones on for. Also? Another reason I will love the DNA Lounge forever, because every time I go there, I will always be reminded of one of the most memorable weddings I have ever had the good fortune and grace to be a part of. </p>

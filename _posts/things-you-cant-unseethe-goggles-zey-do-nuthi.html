        <p>One of the side-effects of the internet was that it made an anonymous space where people could share strange and taboo fetishes, ideas, and other activities and not worry about immediate persecution at their work or home (well, unless you leave the browser window open). At a certain point, it all reached critical mass and tipped into simply well known knowledge&#8230; For example: CSI&#8217;s somewhat infamous furries episode. Imagine that ten years ago &#8211; there&#8217;s simply no way that would have made it onto basic cable, and not prime time on any niche pay to play channels. </p> <p></p> <p>The side effect is that everyone&#8217;s definition of what constitutes a niche product has become rather&#8230; more elastic. So, in that vein, I give you this:</p> <p></p> <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

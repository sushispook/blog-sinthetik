<p>&#8230; although I&#8217;m not casting aspersions in advance at anyone I know, just more concerned with the temperature of people&#8217;s feelings &amp; possible verbal combustion. </p><p></p><p>Having said that&#8230; for anyone who follows me on any social networks, you may have noticed that the vast majority of the people I count as friends (both in the actual sense of the word and the bubble-gum-esque neo-definition that seems to be the coin of the realm in many modern social settings on the internet) are of the female gender. Now, as a hetero guy, I like women. I&#8217;m rather keen on them, you might say, and I could say rather a lot about it if decorum wasn&#8217;t an issue. But it is, and besides the fact that&#8217;s not why the numbers skew the way they do when it comes to whom I interact with online. </p><p></p><p>The simple fact of the matter is that I tend to get along quite a bit better with the opposite gender. I&#8217;ve had some pet theories around that, but when I&#8217;ve bothered to really dig into them, they&#8217;ve really never held up to scrutiny. Sure, my dad wasn&#8217;t around much when I was growing up so I spent a ton of time with my mom and my sisters, and I also spent a good chunk of time growing up being bullied by guys&#8230; but mostly, think it comes down to something that you can see in this video&#8230; take a moment to watch (some questionable/possibly vulgar content, headphones if you&#8217;re at work): </p><p></p><p><iframe allowfullscreen src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/g05OlRa0vzE?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p><p></p><p>In my own life experience, the perpetrator of giant metal chickens in the house, or a plan to shout &#8220;WOLVERINES&#8221; loudly is usually female, and not male. I&#8217;m not totally sure why this is, but in my life so far, this has proven to be the case. </p><p></p><p>I&#8217;m not trying to start a discussion about the divisions between the sexes, or the politics surrounding those divisions. And I&#8217;m not saying unequivocally that the majority of men are staid grumpuses or are not prone to the sort of frivolity that I personally find to be nourishment for the soul &#8211; rather I&#8217;m just saying that&#8217;s the way my life has arranged my experiences, and as a result, my preferences. It&#8217;s also hilariously ironic, because as a teenager, I was possessed of such crippling anxiety, ESPECIALLY around girls, that it&#8217;s a wonder I didn&#8217;t regularly defecate and flee like a squid shooting out ink to confuse a predator. </p><p></p><p>I&#8217;m happy to open discussion about this, with the caveat that everyone is to be respectful, and I would also recommend lots of &#8220;I&#8221; statements as opposed to &#8220;you&#8221; or &#8220;they&#8221;, etc etc etc. But I&#8217;m curious if any of you have a similar breakdown and why you think that might be &#8211; or if there&#8217;s really some sort of gender barrier out there towards a certain kind &amp; level of frivolity. </p>

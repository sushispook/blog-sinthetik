<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I am a big fan of law enforcement, and those that make sure that the laws put in place to make sure I don&rsquo;t drink turpentine or get trampled to death because the bar or club is so far out of code that we might as well be dancing on top of a giant mouse trap. And as someone who has lived in less than savory areas, I&rsquo;m pretty solidly behind common sense application of law enforcement &ndash; if you&rsquo;re in a residential neighborhood, quality of life is more than just buzz-phrase, it&rsquo;s a huge, and often under-appreciated factor in how you are able to live your life. Having been on the ass-end of some ridiculous behavior, all in the name of &ldquo;fun&rdquo;, sometimes having the cops come down hard is the option of <strong><em>last resort</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to fall in line with the get-off-my-lawn crowd either &ndash; because what can be found in San Francisco&rsquo;s nightlife isn&rsquo;t just drunken revelry, but some of the most amazing celebrations of artistic joy I have ever had the pleasure and privilege to witness. It is, quite simply, some of the most fun I&rsquo;ve ever had in my entire life, and given me memories to last a life time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And apparently, someone has a problem with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, the general gripes of law enforcement causing problems and being a buzzkill became something more, and rumbled at a higher volume. Somewhere along the line, it stopped being about law enforcement, and turned into a grudge, and ultimately, into a vendetta. Enter Bertrand and Ott, the self-styled batman and robin-esque crusaders against immoral and unpleasant behavior&hellip; or at least, there definition of. It&rsquo;s gone far beyond simply ensuring the health and safety of the patrons of SF&rsquo;s nightlife, and into a full-fledged push to make life so unpleasant and so difficult, that the cost and hassle of continuing to operate a legitimate, law-abiding business becomes untenable and/or unworkable. They do this by always bring the same arsenal of tricks: enforcing the law in the most heavy handed way possible, through intimidation and fear &ndash; and timed in a calculating way to cause the most difficulty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like being protected &ndash; not just from outright criminals on the streets, but from those business owners who would take advantage of me as well&hellip; especially when my guard is down because I&rsquo;m out to have a night of fun. But in this day and age, moral crusades, especially those at the expense of the taxpayer, and waged through a proxy of harsh interpretation of ill-defined laws, is outrageous. And these officers, backed by their superiors, get away with it because who cares about night club patrons, employees, and owners?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the employees and owners are the same cross-section of small business owners that you can find out in many industries. There is definitely a share of unsavory characters, and likely more than the usual share of per-capita sleazebags &ndash; but there are also people who are just trying to make a living with the only marketable skills they have&hellip; and those that do it for the love of fun, of being part of something more than just a weekend party, but a venue for celebration of life, culture, and yes, <strong>fun</strong>. And the patrons that go here are people &ndash; people from <em>everywhere</em>, all over the bay area, from all professions and all walks of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the age of budget deficits and concerns about revenue, it&rsquo;s stone-age thinking to make it more difficult to come into San Francisco and spend money at local establishments. Enough &ndash; enough of the heavy handed tactics, of law enforcement agencies desperately trying to justify their existence, and of delusional bullies who think they&rsquo;re fighting some good versus evil crusade.</p>

</p> <p></p> <p>Apparently <b><a href="http://www.geekologie.com/2010/10/another_day_another_creepy_fet.php">the internets thinks that this is inflatable alien fetish wear</a></b>. I would like to correct everyone, and point out that this is part of an upcoming child safety campaign, wherein Pubert the Safety Shuggoth instructs children to look both ways before crossing the street, never to trust strangers, and to <b><i>always</i></b> use fresh entrails during a summoning. </p>

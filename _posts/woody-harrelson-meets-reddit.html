      <p>&#8230; <b><a href="http://www.observer.com/2012/02/woody-harrelson-and-the-no-good-very-bad-reddit-ama/">and it doesn&#8217;t go well at all</a></b>: </p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i>What happened? Where did it all go wrong for one of Hollywood&#8217;s most happy-go-lucky weed activists? Probably at the outset. Redditors take the literal meaning of AMA seriously&#8211;they expect to be able to ask the subject anything. That&#8217;s just what a Reddit user with the screen name &#8220;AndyRooney&#8221; chose to do:</i></p> <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><i></i></p> <p style="margin-left: 1.0in;"><i>I swear this is a true story. I went to a high school in LA and you crashed our prom after party (Universal Hilton). You ended up taking the virginity of a girl named Roseanna. You didn&#8217;t call her afterwards. She cried a lot. Do you remember any of this and can confirm or have you been so knee deep in hollywood pooty for so long that this qualifies as a mere blip? (&#8230;)</i></p>

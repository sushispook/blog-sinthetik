<p>        </p><div> <p>I remember this one getting some airplay on the local alternative radio station (alternative before it devolved into Nickelback&#8217;s descendants), and like a lot of techno in the early 90&#8217;s, they went away pretty quickly after this one hit. It&#8217;s funny, because I&#8217;ve still got the disc for this, and it&#8217;s a 2-track single &#8211; something that you don&#8217;t see at all these days, it would never sell when people could just go buy it on iTunes.</p> <p></p> <p><i><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">(Yes, this will be a regular Friday thing from now on)</span></i></p> </div>
